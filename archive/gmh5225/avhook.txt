                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     If a subjectAltName extension of type dNSName is present, that MUST
     be used as the identity. Otherwise, the (most specific) Common Name
     field in the Subject field of the certificate MUST be used. Although
     the use of the Common Name is existing practice, it is deprecated and
     Certification Authorities are encouraged to use the dNSName instead.

     Matching is performed using the matching rules specified by
     [RFC2459].  If more than one identity of a given type is present in
     the certificate (e.g., more than one dNSName name, a match in any one
     of the set is considered acceptable.) Names may contain the wildcard
     character * which is considered to match any single domain name
     component or component fragment. E.g., *.a.com matches foo.a.com but
     not bar.foo.a.com. f*.com matches foo.com but not bar.com.

     In some cases, the URI is specified as an IP address rather than a
     hostname. In this case, the iPAddress subjectAltName must be present
     in the certificate and must exactly match the IP in the URI.

// COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS FOR DEAR IMGUI
// Runtime options (clipboard callbacks, enabling various features, etc.) can generally be set via the ImGuiIO structure.
// You can use ImGui::SetAllocatorFunctions() before calling ImGui::CreateContext() to rewire memory allocation functions.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A) You may edit imconfig.h (and not overwrite it when updating Dear ImGui, or maintain a patch/rebased branch with your modifications to it)
// B) or '#define IMGUI_USER_CONFIG "my_imgui_config.h"' in your project and then add directives in your own file without touching this template.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// You need to make sure that configuration settings are defined consistently _everywhere_ Dear ImGui is used, which include the imgui*.cpp
// files but also _any_ of your code that uses Dear ImGui. This is because some compile-time options have an affect on data structures.
// Defining those options in imconfig.h will ensure every compilation unit gets to see the same data structure layouts.
// Call IMGUI_CHECKVERSION() from your .cpp files to verify that the data structures your files are using are matching the ones imgui.cpp is using.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//---- Use 32-bit vertex indices (default is 16-bit) is one way to allow large meshes with more than 64K vertices.
// Your renderer backend will need to support it (most example renderer backends support both 16/32-bit indices).
// Another way to allow large meshes while keeping 16-bit indices is to handle ImDrawCmd::VtxOffset in your renderer.
// Read about ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset for details.
//#define ImDrawIdx unsigned int

//---- Override ImDrawCallback signature (will need to modify renderer backends accordingly)
//struct ImDrawList;
//struct ImDrawCmd;
//typedef void (*MyImDrawCallback)(const ImDrawList* draw_list, const ImDrawCmd* cmd, void* my_renderer_user_data);
//#define ImDrawCallback MyImDrawCallback

//---- Debug Tools: Macro to break in Debugger
// (use 'Metrics->Tools->Item Picker' to pick widgets with the mouse and break into them for easy debugging.)
//#define IM_DEBUG_BREAK  IM_ASSERT(0)
//#define IM_DEBUG_BREAK  __debugbreak()

//---- Debug Tools: Have the Item Picker break in the ItemAdd() function instead of ItemHoverable(),
// (which comes earlier in the code, will catch a few extra items, allow picking items other than Hovered one.)
// This adds a small runtime cost which is why it is not enabled by default.
//#define IMGUI_DEBUG_TOOL_ITEM_PICKER_EX

//---- Debug Tools: Enable slower asserts
//#define IMGUI_DEBUG_PARANOID

//---- Tip: You can add extra functions within the ImGui:: namespace, here or in your own headers files.

 MISSION STATEMENT
 =================

 - Easy to use to create code-driven and data-driven tools.
 - Easy to use to create ad hoc short-lived tools and long-lived, more elaborate tools.
 - Easy to hack and improve.
 - Minimize setup and maintenance.
 - Minimize state storage on user side.
 - Portable, minimize dependencies, run on target (consoles, phones, etc.).
 - Efficient runtime and memory consumption.

 Designed for developers and content-creators, not the typical end-user! Some of the current weaknesses includes:

 - Doesn't look fancy, doesn't animate.
 - Limited layout features, intricate layouts are typically crafted in code.


 END-USER GUIDE
 ==============

 - Double-click on title bar to collapse window.
 - Click upper right corner to close a window, available when 'bool* p_open' is passed to ImGui::Begin().
 - Click and drag on lower right corner to resize window (double-click to auto fit window to its contents).
 - Click and drag on any empty space to move window.
 - TAB/SHIFT+TAB to cycle through keyboard editable fields.
 - CTRL+Click on a slider or drag box to input value as text.
 - Use mouse wheel to scroll.
 - Text editor:
   - Hold SHIFT or use mouse to select text.
   - CTRL+Left/Right to word jump.
   - CTRL+Shift+Left/Right to select words.
   - CTRL+A our Double-Click to select all.
   - CTRL+X,CTRL+C,CTRL+V to use OS clipboard/
   - CTRL+Z,CTRL+Y to undo/redo.
   - ESCAPE to revert text to its original value.
   - You can apply arithmetic operators +,*,/ on numerical values. Use +- to subtract (because - would set a negative value!)
   - Controls are automatically adjusted for OSX to match standard OSX text editing operations.
 - General Keyboard controls: enable with ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard.
 - General Gamepad controls: enable with ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad. See suggested mappings in imgui.h ImGuiNavInput_ + download PNG/PSD at http://dearimgui.org/controls_sheets


 PROGRAMMER GUIDE
 ================

 READ FIRST
 ----------
 - Remember to check the wonderful Wiki (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki)
 - Your code creates the UI, if your code doesn't run the UI is gone! The UI can be highly dynamic, there are no construction or
   destruction steps, less superfluous data retention on your side, less state duplication, less state synchronization, fewer bugs.
 - Call and read ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() for demo code demonstrating most features.
 - The library is designed to be built from sources. Avoid pre-compiled binaries and packaged versions. See imconfig.h to configure your build.
 - Dear ImGui is an implementation of the IMGUI paradigm (immediate-mode graphical user interface, a term coined by Casey Muratori).
   You can learn about IMGUI principles at http://www.johno.se/book/imgui.html, http://mollyrocket.com/861 & more links in Wiki.
 - Dear ImGui is a "single pass" rasterizing implementation of the IMGUI paradigm, aimed at ease of use and high-performances.
   For every application frame, your UI code will be called only once. This is in contrast to e.g. Unity's implementation of an IMGUI,
   where the UI code is called multiple times ("multiple passes") from a single entry point. There are pros and cons to both approaches.
 - Our origin is on the top-left. In axis aligned bounding boxes, Min = top-left, Max = bottom-right.
 - This codebase is also optimized to yield decent performances with typical "Debug" builds settings.
 - Please make sure you have asserts enabled (IM_ASSERT redirects to assert() by default, but can be redirected).
   If you get an assert, read the messages and comments around the assert.
 - C++: this is a very C-ish codebase: we don't rely on C++11, we don't include any C++ headers, and ImGui:: is a namespace.
 - C++: ImVec2/ImVec4 do not expose math operators by default, because it is expected that you use your own math types.
   See FAQ "How can I use my own math types instead of ImVec2/ImVec4?" for details about setting up imconfig.h for that.
   However, imgui_internal.h can optionally export math operators for ImVec2/ImVec4, which we use in this codebase.
 - C++: pay attention that ImVector<> manipulates plain-old-data and does not honor construction/destruction (avoid using it in your code!).


 HOW TO UPDATE TO A NEWER VERSION OF DEAR IMGUI
 ----------------------------------------------
 - Overwrite all the sources files except for imconfig.h (if you have modified your copy of imconfig.h)
 - Or maintain your own branch where you have imconfig.h modified as a top-most commit which you can regularly rebase over "master".
 - You can also use '#define IMGUI_USER_CONFIG "my_config_file.h" to redirect configuration to your own file.
 - Read the "API BREAKING CHANGES" section (below). This is where we list occasional API breaking changes.
   If a function/type has been renamed / or marked obsolete, try to fix the name in your code before it is permanently removed
   from the public API. If you have a problem with a missing function/symbols, search for its name in the code, there will
   likely be a comment about it. Please report any issue to the GitHub page!
 - To find out usage of old API, you can add '#define IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS' in your configuration file.
 - Try to keep your copy of Dear ImGui reasonably up to date.


 GETTING STARTED WITH INTEGRATING DEAR IMGUI IN YOUR CODE/ENGINE
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 - Run and study the examples and demo in imgui_demo.cpp to get acquainted with the library.
 - In the majority of cases you should be able to use unmodified backends files available in the backends/ folder.
 - Add the Dear ImGui source files + selected backend source files to your projects or using your preferred build system.
   It is recommended you build and statically link the .cpp files as part of your project and NOT as a shared library (DLL).
 - You can later customize the imconfig.h file to tweak some compile-time behavior, such as integrating Dear ImGui types with your own maths types.
 - When using Dear ImGui, your programming IDE is your friend: follow the declaration of variables, functions and types to find comments about them.
 - Dear ImGui never touches or knows about your GPU state. The only function that knows about GPU is the draw function that you provide.
   Effectively it means you can create widgets at any time in your code, regardless of considerations of being in "update" vs "render"
   phases of your own application. All rendering information is stored into command-lists that you will retrieve after calling ImGui::Render().
 - Refer to the backends and demo applications in the examples/ folder for instruction on how to setup your code.
 - If you are running over a standard OS with a common graphics API, you should be able to use unmodified imgui_impl_*** files from the examples/ folder.


 HOW A SIMPLE APPLICATION MAY LOOK LIKE
 --------------------------------------
 EXHIBIT 1: USING THE EXAMPLE BACKENDS (= imgui_impl_XXX.cpp files from the backends/ folder).
 The sub-folders in examples/ contain examples applications following this structure.

     // Application init: create a dear imgui context, setup some options, load fonts
     ImGui::CreateContext();
     ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
     // TODO: Set optional io.ConfigFlags values, e.g. 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard' to enable keyboard controls.
     // TODO: Fill optional fields of the io structure later.
     // TODO: Load TTF/OTF fonts if you don't want to use the default font.

     // Initialize helper Platform and Renderer backends (here we are using imgui_impl_win32.cpp and imgui_impl_dx11.cpp)
     ImGui_ImplWin32_Init(hwnd);
     ImGui_ImplDX11_Init(g_pd3dDevice, g_pd3dDeviceContext);

     // Application main loop
     while (true)
     {
         // Feed inputs to dear imgui, start new frame
         ImGui_ImplDX11_NewFrame();
         ImGui_ImplWin32_NewFrame();
         ImGui::NewFrame();

         // Any application code here
         ImGui::Text("Hello, world!");

         // Render dear imgui into screen
         ImGui::Render();
         ImGui_ImplDX11_RenderDrawData(ImGui::GetDrawData());
         g_pSwapChain->Present(1, 0);
     }

     // Shutdown
     ImGui_ImplDX11_Shutdown();
     ImGui_ImplWin32_Shutdown();
     ImGui::DestroyContext();

 EXHIBIT 2: IMPLEMENTING CUSTOM BACKEND / CUSTOM ENGINE

     // Application init: create a dear imgui context, setup some options, load fonts
     ImGui::CreateContext();
     ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
     // TODO: Set optional io.ConfigFlags values, e.g. 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard' to enable keyboard controls.
     // TODO: Fill optional fields of the io structure later.
     // TODO: Load TTF/OTF fonts if you don't want to use the default font.

     // Build and load the texture atlas into a texture
     // (In the examples/ app this is usually done within the ImGui_ImplXXX_Init() function from one of the demo Renderer)
     int width, height;
     unsigned char* pixels = NULL;
     io.Fonts->GetTexDataAsRGBA32(&pixels, &width, &height);

     // At this point you've got the texture data and you need to upload that to your graphic system:
     // After we have created the texture, store its pointer/identifier (_in whichever format your engine uses_) in 'io.Fonts->TexID'.
     // This will be passed back to your via the renderer. Basically ImTextureID == void*. Read FAQ for details about ImTextureID.
     MyTexture* texture = MyEngine::CreateTextureFromMemoryPixels(pixels, width, height, TEXTURE_TYPE_RGBA32)
     io.Fonts->SetTexID((void*)texture);

     // Application main loop
     while (true)
     {
        // Setup low-level inputs, e.g. on Win32: calling GetKeyboardState(), or write to those fields from your Windows message handlers, etc.
        // (In the examples/ app this is usually done within the ImGui_ImplXXX_NewFrame() function from one of the demo Platform Backends)
        io.DeltaTime = 1.0f/60.0f;              // set the time elapsed since the previous frame (in seconds)
        io.DisplaySize.x = 1920.0f;             // set the current display width
        io.DisplaySize.y = 1280.0f;             // set the current display height here
        io.MousePos = my_mouse_pos;             // set the mouse position
        io.MouseDown[0] = my_mouse_buttons[0];  // set the mouse button states
        io.MouseDown[1] = my_mouse_buttons[1];

        // Call NewFrame(), after this point you can use ImGui::* functions anytime
        // (So you want to try calling NewFrame() as early as you can in your main loop to be able to use Dear ImGui everywhere)
        ImGui::NewFrame();

        // Most of your application code here
        ImGui::Text("Hello, world!");
        MyGameUpdate(); // may use any Dear ImGui functions, e.g. ImGui::Begin("My window"); ImGui::Text("Hello, world!"); ImGui::End();
        MyGameRender(); // may use any Dear ImGui functions as well!

        // Render dear imgui, swap buffers
        // (You want to try calling EndFrame/Render as late as you can, to be able to use Dear ImGui in your own game rendering code)
        ImGui::EndFrame();
        ImGui::Render();
        ImDrawData* draw_data = ImGui::GetDrawData();
        MyImGuiRenderFunction(draw_data);
        SwapBuffers();
     }

     // Shutdown
     ImGui::DestroyContext();

 To decide whether to dispatch mouse/keyboard inputs to Dear ImGui to the rest of your application,
 you should read the 'io.WantCaptureMouse', 'io.WantCaptureKeyboard' and 'io.WantTextInput' flags!
 Please read the FAQ and example applications for details about this!


 HOW A SIMPLE RENDERING FUNCTION MAY LOOK LIKE
 ---------------------------------------------
 The backends in impl_impl_XXX.cpp files contain many working implementations of a rendering function.

    void void MyImGuiRenderFunction(ImDrawData* draw_data)
    {
       // TODO: Setup render state: alpha-blending enabled, no face culling, no depth testing, scissor enabled
       // TODO: Setup viewport covering draw_data->DisplayPos to draw_data->DisplayPos + draw_data->DisplaySize
       // TODO: Setup orthographic projection matrix cover draw_data->DisplayPos to draw_data->DisplayPos + draw_data->DisplaySize
       // TODO: Setup shader: vertex { float2 pos, float2 uv, u32 color }, fragment shader sample color from 1 texture, multiply by vertex color.
       for (int n = 0; n < draw_data->CmdListsCount; n++)
       {
          const ImDrawList* cmd_list = draw_data->CmdLists[n];
          const ImDrawVert* vtx_buffer = cmd_list->VtxBuffer.Data;  // vertex buffer generated by Dear ImGui
          const ImDrawIdx* idx_buffer = cmd_list->IdxBuffer.Data;   // index buffer generated by Dear ImGui
          for (int cmd_i = 0; cmd_i < cmd_list->CmdBuffer.Size; cmd_i++)
          {
             const ImDrawCmd* pcmd = &cmd_list->CmdBuffer[cmd_i];
             if (pcmd->UserCallback)
             {
                 pcmd->UserCallback(cmd_list, pcmd);
             }
             else
             {
                 // The texture for the draw call is specified by pcmd->GetTexID().
                 // The vast majority of draw calls will use the Dear ImGui texture atlas, which value you have set yourself during initialization.
                 MyEngineBindTexture((MyTexture*)pcmd->GetTexID());

                 // We are using scissoring to clip some objects. All low-level graphics API should support it.
                 // - If your engine doesn't support scissoring yet, you may ignore this at first. You will get some small glitches
                 //   (some elements visible outside their bounds) but you can fix that once everything else works!
                 // - Clipping coordinates are provided in imgui coordinates space:
                 //   - For a given viewport, draw_data->DisplayPos == viewport->Pos and draw_data->DisplaySize == viewport->Size
                 //   - In a single viewport application, draw_data->DisplayPos == (0,0) and draw_data->DisplaySize == io.DisplaySize, but always use GetMainViewport()->Pos/Size instead of hardcoding those values.
                 //   - In the interest of supporting multi-viewport applications (see 'docking' branch on github),
                 //     always subtract draw_data->DisplayPos from clipping bounds to convert them to your viewport space.
                 // - Note that pcmd->ClipRect contains Min+Max bounds. Some graphics API may use Min+Max, other may use Min+Size (size being Max-Min)
                 ImVec2 pos = draw_data->DisplayPos;
                 MyEngineScissor((int)(pcmd->ClipRect.x - pos.x), (int)(pcmd->ClipRect.y - pos.y), (int)(pcmd->ClipRect.z - pos.x), (int)(pcmd->ClipRect.w - pos.y));

                 // Render 'pcmd->ElemCount/3' indexed triangles.
                 // By default the indices ImDrawIdx are 16-bit, you can change them to 32-bit in imconfig.h if your engine doesn't support 16-bit indices.
                 MyEngineDrawIndexedTriangles(pcmd->ElemCount, sizeof(ImDrawIdx) == 2 ? GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT : GL_UNSIGNED_INT, idx_buffer, vtx_buffer);
             }
             idx_buffer += pcmd->ElemCount;
          }
       }
    }


 USING GAMEPAD/KEYBOARD NAVIGATION CONTROLS
 ------------------------------------------
 - The gamepad/keyboard navigation is fairly functional and keeps being improved.
 - Gamepad support is particularly useful to use Dear ImGui on a console system (e.g. PS4, Switch, XB1) without a mouse!
 - You can ask questions and report issues at https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/787
 - The initial focus was to support game controllers, but keyboard is becoming increasingly and decently usable.
 - Keyboard:
    - Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard to enable.
      NewFrame() will automatically fill io.NavInputs[] based on your io.KeysDown[] + io.KeyMap[] arrays.
    - When keyboard navigation is active (io.NavActive + ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableKeyboard), the io.WantCaptureKeyboard flag
      will be set. For more advanced uses, you may want to read from:
       - io.NavActive: true when a window is focused and it doesn't have the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoNavInputs flag set.
       - io.NavVisible: true when the navigation cursor is visible (and usually goes false when mouse is used).
       - or query focus information with e.g. IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_AnyWindow), IsItemFocused() etc. functions.
      Please reach out if you think the game vs navigation input sharing could be improved.
 - Gamepad:
    - Set io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad to enable.
    - Backend: Set io.BackendFlags |= ImGuiBackendFlags_HasGamepad + fill the io.NavInputs[] fields before calling NewFrame().
      Note that io.NavInputs[] is cleared by EndFrame().
    - See 'enum ImGuiNavInput_' in imgui.h for a description of inputs. For each entry of io.NavInputs[], set the following values:
         0.0f= not held. 1.0f= fully held. Pass intermediate 0.0f..1.0f values for analog triggers/sticks.
    - We use a simple >0.0f test for activation testing, and won't attempt to test for a dead-zone.
      Your code will probably need to transform your raw inputs (such as e.g. remapping your 0.2..0.9 raw input range to 0.0..1.0 imgui range, etc.).
    - You can download PNG/PSD files depicting the gamepad controls for common controllers at: http://dearimgui.org/controls_sheets
    - If you need to share inputs between your game and the imgui parts, the easiest approach is to go all-or-nothing, with a buttons combo
      to toggle the target. Please reach out if you think the game vs navigation input sharing could be improved.
 - Mouse:
    - PS4 users: Consider emulating a mouse cursor with DualShock4 touch pad or a spare analog stick as a mouse-emulation fallback.
    - Consoles/Tablet/Phone users: Consider using a Synergy 1.x server (on your PC) + uSynergy.c (on your console/tablet/phone app) to share your PC mouse/keyboard.
    - On a TV/console system where readability may be lower or mouse inputs may be awkward, you may want to set the ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos flag.
      Enabling ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableSetMousePos + ImGuiBackendFlags_HasSetMousePos instructs dear imgui to move your mouse cursor along with navigation movements.
      When enabled, the NewFrame() function may alter 'io.MousePos' and set 'io.WantSetMousePos' to notify you that it wants the mouse cursor to be moved.
      When that happens your backend NEEDS to move the OS or underlying mouse cursor on the next frame. Some of the backends in examples/ do that.
      (If you set the NavEnableSetMousePos flag but don't honor 'io.WantSetMousePos' properly, imgui will misbehave as it will see your mouse moving back and forth!)
      (In a setup when you may not have easy control over the mouse cursor, e.g. uSynergy.c doesn't expose moving remote mouse cursor, you may want
       to set a boolean to ignore your other external mouse positions until the external source is moved again.)


 API BREAKING CHANGES
 ====================

 Occasionally introducing changes that are breaking the API. We try to make the breakage minor and easy to fix.
 Below is a change-log of API breaking changes only. If you are using one of the functions listed, expect to have to fix some code.
 When you are not sure about an old symbol or function name, try using the Search/Find function of your IDE to look for comments or references in all imgui files.
 You can read releases logs https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases for more details.

 - 2022/03/01 (1.87) - commented out redirecting functions/enums names that were marked obsolete in 1.69, 1.70, 1.71, 1.72 (March-July 2019)
                        - ImGui::SetNextTreeNodeOpen()        -> use ImGui::SetNextItemOpen()
                        - ImGui::GetContentRegionAvailWidth() -> use ImGui::GetContentRegionAvail().x
                        - ImGui::TreeAdvanceToLabelPos()      -> use ImGui::SetCursorPosX(ImGui::GetCursorPosX() + ImGui::GetTreeNodeToLabelSpacing());
                        - ImFontAtlas::CustomRect             -> use ImFontAtlasCustomRect
                        - ImGuiColorEditFlags_RGB/HSV/HEX     -> use ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayRGB/HSV/Hex
 - 2021/12/20 (1.86) - backends: removed obsolete Marmalade backend (imgui_impl_marmalade.cpp) + example. Find last supported version at https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Bindings
 - 2021/11/04 (1.86) - removed CalcListClipping() function. Prefer using ImGuiListClipper which can return non-contiguous ranges. Please open an issue if you think you really need this function.
 - 2021/08/23 (1.85) - removed GetWindowContentRegionWidth() function. keep inline redirection helper. can use 'GetWindowContentRegionMax().x - GetWindowContentRegionMin().x' instead for generally 'GetContentRegionAvail().x' is more useful.
 - 2021/07/26 (1.84) - commented out redirecting functions/enums names that were marked obsolete in 1.67 and 1.69 (March 2019):
                        - ImGui::GetOverlayDrawList() -> use ImGui::GetForegroundDrawList()
                        - ImFont::GlyphRangesBuilder  -> use ImFontGlyphRangesBuilder
 - 2021/05/19 (1.83) - backends: obsoleted direct access to ImDrawCmd::TextureId in favor of calling ImDrawCmd::GetTexID().
                        - if you are using official backends from the source tree: you have nothing to do.
                        - if you have copied old backend code or using your own: change access to draw_cmd->TextureId to draw_cmd->GetTexID().
 - 2021/03/12 (1.82) - upgraded ImDrawList::AddRect(), AddRectFilled(), PathRect() to use ImDrawFlags instead of ImDrawCornersFlags.
                        - ImDrawCornerFlags_TopLeft  -> use ImDrawFlags_RoundCornersTopLeft
                        - ImDrawCornerFlags_BotRight -> use ImDrawFlags_RoundCornersBottomRight
                        - ImDrawCornerFlags_None     -> use ImDrawFlags_RoundCornersNone etc.
                       flags now sanely defaults to 0 instead of 0x0F, consistent with all other flags in the API.
                       breaking: the default with rounding > 0.0f is now "round all corners" vs old implicit "round no corners":
                        - rounding == 0.0f + flags == 0 --> meant no rounding  --> unchanged (common use)
                        - rounding  > 0.0f + flags != 0 --> meant rounding     --> unchanged (common use)
                        - rounding == 0.0f + flags != 0 --> meant no rounding  --> unchanged (unlikely use)
                        - rounding  > 0.0f + flags == 0 --> meant no rounding  --> BREAKING (unlikely use): will now round all corners --> use ImDrawFlags_RoundCornersNone or rounding == 0.0f.
                       this ONLY matters for hard coded use of 0 + rounding > 0.0f. Use of named ImDrawFlags_RoundCornersNone (new) or ImDrawCornerFlags_None (old) are ok.
                       the old ImDrawCornersFlags used awkward default values of ~0 or 0xF (4 lower bits set) to signify "round all corners" and we sometimes encouraged using them as shortcuts.
                       legacy path still support use of hard coded ~0 or any value from 0x1 or 0xF. They will behave the same with legacy paths enabled (will assert otherwise).
 - 2021/03/11 (1.82) - removed redirecting functions/enums names that were marked obsolete in 1.66 (September 2018):
                        - ImGui::SetScrollHere()              -> use ImGui::SetScrollHereY()
 - 2021/03/11 (1.82) - clarified that ImDrawList::PathArcTo(), ImDrawList::PathArcToFast() won't render with radius < 0.0f. Previously it sorts of accidentally worked but would generally lead to counter-clockwise paths and have an effect on anti-aliasing.
 - 2021/03/10 (1.82) - upgraded ImDrawList::AddPolyline() and PathStroke() "bool closed" parameter to "ImDrawFlags flags". The matching ImDrawFlags_Closed value is guaranteed to always stay == 1 in the future.
 - 2021/02/22 (1.82) - (*undone in 1.84*) win32+mingw: Re-enabled IME functions by default even under MinGW. In July 2016, issue #738 had me incorrectly disable those default functions for MinGW. MinGW users should: either link with -limm32, either set their imconfig file  with '#define IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_IME_FUNCTIONS'.
 - 2021/02/17 (1.82) - renamed rarely used style.CircleSegmentMaxError (old default = 1.60f) to style.CircleTessellationMaxError (new default = 0.30f) as the meaning of the value changed.
 - 2021/02/03 (1.81) - renamed ListBoxHeader(const char* label, ImVec2 size) to BeginListBox(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
                     - removed ListBoxHeader(const char* label, int items_count, int height_in_items = -1) in favor of specifying size. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
                     - renamed ListBoxFooter() to EndListBox(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2021/01/26 (1.81) - removed ImGuiFreeType::BuildFontAtlas(). Kept inline redirection function. Prefer using '#define IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE', but there's a runtime selection path available too. The shared extra flags parameters (very rarely used) are now stored in ImFontAtlas::FontBuilderFlags.
                     - renamed ImFontConfig::RasterizerFlags (used by FreeType) to ImFontConfig::FontBuilderFlags.
                     - renamed ImGuiFreeType::XXX flags to ImGuiFreeTypeBuilderFlags_XXX for consistency with other API.
 - 2020/10/12 (1.80) - removed redirecting functions/enums that were marked obsolete in 1.63 (August 2018):
                        - ImGui::IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() -> use ImGui::IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit().
                        - ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDarkening       -> use ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDimBg
                        - ImGuiInputTextCallback              -> use ImGuiTextEditCallback
                        - ImGuiInputTextCallbackData          -> use ImGuiTextEditCallbackData
 - 2020/12/21 (1.80) - renamed ImDrawList::AddBezierCurve() to AddBezierCubic(), and PathBezierCurveTo() to PathBezierCubicCurveTo(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2020/12/04 (1.80) - added imgui_tables.cpp file! Manually constructed project files will need the new file added!
 - 2020/11/18 (1.80) - renamed undocumented/internals ImGuiColumnsFlags_* to ImGuiOldColumnFlags_* in prevision of incoming Tables API.
 - 2020/11/03 (1.80) - renamed io.ConfigWindowsMemoryCompactTimer to io.ConfigMemoryCompactTimer as the feature will apply to other data structures
 - 2020/10/14 (1.80) - backends: moved all backends files (imgui_impl_XXXX.cpp, imgui_impl_XXXX.h) from examples/ to backends/.
 - 2020/10/12 (1.80) - removed redirecting functions/enums that were marked obsolete in 1.60 (April 2018):
                        - io.RenderDrawListsFn pointer        -> use ImGui::GetDrawData() value and call the render function of your backend
                        - ImGui::IsAnyWindowFocused()         -> use ImGui::IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_AnyWindow)
                        - ImGui::IsAnyWindowHovered()         -> use ImGui::IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow)
                        - ImGuiStyleVar_Count_                -> use ImGuiStyleVar_COUNT
                        - ImGuiMouseCursor_Count_             -> use ImGuiMouseCursor_COUNT
                      - removed redirecting functions names that were marked obsolete in 1.61 (May 2018):
                        - InputFloat (... int decimal_precision ...) -> use InputFloat (... const char* format ...) with format = "%.Xf" where X is your value for decimal_precision.
                        - same for InputFloat2()/InputFloat3()/InputFloat4() variants taking a `int decimal_precision` parameter.
 - 2020/10/05 (1.79) - removed ImGuiListClipper: Renamed constructor parameters which created an ambiguous alternative to using the ImGuiListClipper::Begin() function, with misleading edge cases (note: imgui_memory_editor <0.40 from imgui_club/ used this old clipper API. Update your copy if needed).
 - 2020/09/25 (1.79) - renamed ImGuiSliderFlags_ClampOnInput to ImGuiSliderFlags_AlwaysClamp. Kept redirection enum (will obsolete sooner because previous name was added recently).
 - 2020/09/25 (1.79) - renamed style.TabMinWidthForUnselectedCloseButton to style.TabMinWidthForCloseButton.
 - 2020/09/21 (1.79) - renamed OpenPopupContextItem() back to OpenPopupOnItemClick(), reverting the change from 1.77. For varieties of reason this is more self-explanatory.
 - 2020/09/21 (1.79) - removed return value from OpenPopupOnItemClick() - returned true on mouse release on an item - because it is inconsistent with other popup APIs and makes others misleading. It's also and unnecessary: you can use IsWindowAppearing() after BeginPopup() for a similar result.
 - 2020/09/17 (1.79) - removed ImFont::DisplayOffset in favor of ImFontConfig::GlyphOffset. DisplayOffset was applied after scaling and not very meaningful/useful outside of being needed by the default ProggyClean font. If you scaled this value after calling AddFontDefault(), this is now done automatically. It was also getting in the way of better font scaling, so let's get rid of it now!
 - 2020/08/17 (1.78) - obsoleted use of the trailing 'float power=1.0f' parameter for DragFloat(), DragFloat2(), DragFloat3(), DragFloat4(), DragFloatRange2(), DragScalar(), DragScalarN(), SliderFloat(), SliderFloat2(), SliderFloat3(), SliderFloat4(), SliderScalar(), SliderScalarN(), VSliderFloat() and VSliderScalar().
                       replaced the 'float power=1.0f' argument with integer-based flags defaulting to 0 (as with all our flags).
                       worked out a backward-compatibility scheme so hopefully most C++ codebase should not be affected. in short, when calling those functions:
                       - if you omitted the 'power' parameter (likely!), you are not affected.
                       - if you set the 'power' parameter to 1.0f (same as previous default value): 1/ your compiler may warn on float>int conversion, 2/ everything else will work. 3/ you can replace the 1.0f value with 0 to fix the warning, and be technically correct.
                       - if you set the 'power' parameter to >1.0f (to enable non-linear editing): 1/ your compiler may warn on float>int conversion, 2/ code will assert at runtime, 3/ in case asserts are disabled, the code will not crash and enable the _Logarithmic flag. 4/ you can replace the >1.0f value with ImGuiSliderFlags_Logarithmic to fix the warning/assert and get a _similar_ effect as previous uses of power >1.0f.
                       see https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/3361 for all details.
                       kept inline redirection functions (will obsolete) apart for: DragFloatRange2(), VSliderFloat(), VSliderScalar(). For those three the 'float power=1.0f' version was removed directly as they were most unlikely ever used.
                       for shared code, you can version check at compile-time with `#if IMGUI_VERSION_NUM >= 17704`.
                     - obsoleted use of v_min > v_max in DragInt, DragFloat, DragScalar to lock edits (introduced in 1.73, was not demoed nor documented very), will be replaced by a more generic ReadOnly feature. You may use the ImGuiSliderFlags_ReadOnly internal flag in the meantime.
 - 2020/06/23 (1.77) - removed BeginPopupContextWindow(const char*, int mouse_button, bool also_over_items) in favor of BeginPopupContextWindow(const char*, ImGuiPopupFlags flags) with ImGuiPopupFlags_NoOverItems.
 - 2020/06/15 (1.77) - renamed OpenPopupOnItemClick() to OpenPopupContextItem(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete). [NOTE: THIS WAS REVERTED IN 1.79]
 - 2020/06/15 (1.77) - removed CalcItemRectClosestPoint() entry point which was made obsolete and asserting in December 2017.
 - 2020/04/23 (1.77) - removed unnecessary ID (first arg) of ImFontAtlas::AddCustomRectRegular().
 - 2020/01/22 (1.75) - ImDrawList::AddCircle()/AddCircleFilled() functions don't accept negative radius any more.
 - 2019/12/17 (1.75) - [undid this change in 1.76] made Columns() limited to 64 columns by asserting above that limit. While the current code technically supports it, future code may not so we're putting the restriction ahead.
 - 2019/12/13 (1.75) - [imgui_internal.h] changed ImRect() default constructor initializes all fields to 0.0f instead of (FLT_MAX,FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX). If you used ImRect::Add() to create bounding boxes by adding multiple points into it, you may need to fix your initial value.
 - 2019/12/08 (1.75) - removed redirecting functions/enums that were marked obsolete in 1.53 (December 2017):
                       - ShowTestWindow()                    -> use ShowDemoWindow()
                       - IsRootWindowFocused()               -> use IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootWindow)
                       - IsRootWindowOrAnyChildFocused()     -> use IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootAndChildWindows)
                       - SetNextWindowContentWidth(w)        -> use SetNextWindowContentSize(ImVec2(w, 0.0f)
                       - GetItemsLineHeightWithSpacing()     -> use GetFrameHeightWithSpacing()
                       - ImGuiCol_ChildWindowBg              -> use ImGuiCol_ChildBg
                       - ImGuiStyleVar_ChildWindowRounding   -> use ImGuiStyleVar_ChildRounding
                       - ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlapMode -> use ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap
                       - IMGUI_DISABLE_TEST_WINDOWS          -> use IMGUI_DISABLE_DEMO_WINDOWS
 - 2019/12/08 (1.75) - obsoleted calling ImDrawList::PrimReserve() with a negative count (which was vaguely documented and rarely if ever used). Instead, we added an explicit PrimUnreserve() API.
 - 2019/12/06 (1.75) - removed implicit default parameter to IsMouseDragging(int button = 0) to be consistent with other mouse functions (none of the other functions have it).
 - 2019/11/21 (1.74) - ImFontAtlas::AddCustomRectRegular() now requires an ID larger than 0x110000 (instead of 0x10000) to conform with supporting Unicode planes 1-16 in a future update. ID below 0x110000 will now assert.
 - 2019/11/19 (1.74) - renamed IMGUI_DISABLE_FORMAT_STRING_FUNCTIONS to IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_FORMAT_FUNCTIONS for consistency.
 - 2019/11/19 (1.74) - renamed IMGUI_DISABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS to IMGUI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_MATH_FUNCTIONS for consistency.
 - 2019/10/22 (1.74) - removed redirecting functions/enums that were marked obsolete in 1.52 (October 2017):
                       - Begin() [old 5 args version]        -> use Begin() [3 args], use SetNextWindowSize() SetNextWindowBgAlpha() if needed
                       - IsRootWindowOrAnyChildHovered()     -> use IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RootAndChildWindows)
                       - AlignFirstTextHeightToWidgets()     -> use AlignTextToFramePadding()
                       - SetNextWindowPosCenter()            -> use SetNextWindowPos() with a pivot of (0.5f, 0.5f)
                       - ImFont::Glyph                       -> use ImFontGlyph
 - 2019/10/14 (1.74) - inputs: Fixed a miscalculation in the keyboard/mouse "typematic" repeat delay/rate calculation, used by keys and e.g. repeating mouse buttons as well as the GetKeyPressedAmount() function.
                       if you were using a non-default value for io.KeyRepeatRate (previous default was 0.250), you can add +io.KeyRepeatDelay to it to compensate for the fix.
                       The function was triggering on: 0.0 and (delay+rate*N) where (N>=1). Fixed formula responds to (N>=0). Effectively it made io.KeyRepeatRate behave like it was set to (io.KeyRepeatRate + io.KeyRepeatDelay).
                       If you never altered io.KeyRepeatRate nor used GetKeyPressedAmount() this won't affect you.
 - 2019/07/15 (1.72) - removed TreeAdvanceToLabelPos() which is rarely used and only does SetCursorPosX(GetCursorPosX() + GetTreeNodeToLabelSpacing()). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/07/12 (1.72) - renamed ImFontAtlas::CustomRect to ImFontAtlasCustomRect. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).
 - 2019/06/14 (1.72) - removed redirecting functions/enums names that were marked obsolete in 1.51 (June 2017): ImGuiCol_Column*, ImGuiSetCond_*, IsItemHoveredRect(), IsPosHoveringAnyWindow(), IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow(), IsMouseHoveringWindow(), IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME. Grep this log for details and new names, or see how they were implemented until 1.71.
 - 2019/06/07 (1.71) - rendering of child window outer decorations (bg color, border, scrollbars) is now performed as part of the parent window. If you have
                       overlapping child windows in a same parent, and relied on their relative z-order to be mapped to their submission order, this will affect your rendering.
                       This optimization is disabled if the parent window has no visual output, because it appears to be the most common situation leading to the creation of overlapping child windows.
                       Please reach out if you are affected.
 - 2019/05/13 (1.71) - renamed SetNextTreeNodeOpen() to SetNextItemOpen(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/05/11 (1.71) - changed io.AddInputCharacter(unsigned short c) signature to io.AddInputCharacter(unsigned int c).
 - 2019/04/29 (1.70) - improved ImDrawList thick strokes (>1.0f) preserving correct thickness up to 90 degrees angles (e.g. rectangles). If you have custom rendering using thick lines, they will appear thicker now.
 - 2019/04/29 (1.70) - removed GetContentRegionAvailWidth(), use GetContentRegionAvail().x instead. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/03/04 (1.69) - renamed GetOverlayDrawList() to GetForegroundDrawList(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2019/02/26 (1.69) - renamed ImGuiColorEditFlags_RGB/ImGuiColorEditFlags_HSV/ImGuiColorEditFlags_HEX to ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayRGB/ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayHSV/ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayHex. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
 - 2019/02/14 (1.68) - made it illegal/assert when io.DisplayTime == 0.0f (with an exception for the first frame). If for some reason your time step calculation gives you a zero value, replace it with an arbitrarily small value!
 - 2019/02/01 (1.68) - removed io.DisplayVisibleMin/DisplayVisibleMax (which were marked obsolete and removed from viewport/docking branch already).
 - 2019/01/06 (1.67) - renamed io.InputCharacters[], marked internal as was always intended. Please don't access directly, and use AddInputCharacter() instead!
 - 2019/01/06 (1.67) - renamed ImFontAtlas::GlyphRangesBuilder to ImFontGlyphRangesBuilder. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).
 - 2018/12/20 (1.67) - made it illegal to call Begin("") with an empty string. This somehow half-worked before but had various undesirable side-effects.
 - 2018/12/10 (1.67) - renamed io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges to io.ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges as we are doing a large pass on configuration flags.
 - 2018/10/12 (1.66) - renamed misc/stl/imgui_stl.* to misc/cpp/imgui_stdlib.* in prevision for other C++ helper files.
 - 2018/09/28 (1.66) - renamed SetScrollHere() to SetScrollHereY(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2018/09/06 (1.65) - renamed stb_truetype.h to imstb_truetype.h, stb_textedit.h to imstb_textedit.h, and stb_rect_pack.h to imstb_rectpack.h.
                       If you were conveniently using the imgui copy of those STB headers in your project you will have to update your include paths.
 - 2018/09/05 (1.65) - renamed io.OptCursorBlink/io.ConfigCursorBlink to io.ConfigInputTextCursorBlink. (#1427)
 - 2018/08/31 (1.64) - added imgui_widgets.cpp file, extracted and moved widgets code out of imgui.cpp into imgui_widgets.cpp. Re-ordered some of the code remaining in imgui.cpp.
                       NONE OF THE FUNCTIONS HAVE CHANGED. THE CODE IS SEMANTICALLY 100% IDENTICAL, BUT _EVERY_ FUNCTION HAS BEEN MOVED.
                       Because of this, any local modifications to imgui.cpp will likely conflict when you update. Read docs/CHANGELOG.txt for suggestions.
 - 2018/08/22 (1.63) - renamed IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() to IsItemDeactivatedAfterEdit() for consistency with new IsItemEdited() API. Kept redirection function (will obsolete soonish as IsItemDeactivatedAfterChange() is very recent).
 - 2018/08/21 (1.63) - renamed ImGuiTextEditCallback to ImGuiInputTextCallback, ImGuiTextEditCallbackData to ImGuiInputTextCallbackData for consistency. Kept redirection types (will obsolete).
 - 2018/08/21 (1.63) - removed ImGuiInputTextCallbackData::ReadOnly since it is a duplication of (ImGuiInputTextCallbackData::Flags & ImGuiInputTextFlags_ReadOnly).
 - 2018/08/01 (1.63) - removed per-window ImGuiWindowFlags_ResizeFromAnySide beta flag in favor of a global io.ConfigResizeWindowsFromEdges [update 1.67 renamed to ConfigWindowsResizeFromEdges] to enable the feature.
 - 2018/08/01 (1.63) - renamed io.OptCursorBlink to io.ConfigCursorBlink [-> io.ConfigInputTextCursorBlink in 1.65], io.OptMacOSXBehaviors to ConfigMacOSXBehaviors for consistency.
 - 2018/07/22 (1.63) - changed ImGui::GetTime() return value from float to double to avoid accumulating floating point imprecisions over time.
 - 2018/07/08 (1.63) - style: renamed ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDarkening to ImGuiCol_ModalWindowDimBg for consistency with other features. Kept redirection enum (will obsolete).
 - 2018/06/08 (1.62) - examples: the imgui_impl_XXX files have been split to separate platform (Win32, GLFW, SDL2, etc.) from renderer (DX11, OpenGL, Vulkan,  etc.).
                       old backends will still work as is, however prefer using the separated backends as they will be updated to support multi-viewports.
                       when adopting new backends follow the main.cpp code of your preferred examples/ folder to know which functions to call.
                       in particular, note that old backends called ImGui::NewFrame() at the end of their ImGui_ImplXXXX_NewFrame() function.
 - 2018/06/06 (1.62) - renamed GetGlyphRangesChinese() to GetGlyphRangesChineseFull() to distinguish other variants and discourage using the full set.
 - 2018/06/06 (1.62) - TreeNodeEx()/TreeNodeBehavior(): the ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_CollapsingHeader helper now include the ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_NoTreePushOnOpen flag. See Changelog for details.
 - 2018/05/03 (1.61) - DragInt(): the default compile-time format string has been changed from "%.0f" to "%d", as we are not using integers internally any more.
                       If you used DragInt() with custom format strings, make sure you change them to use %d or an integer-compatible format.
                       To honor backward-compatibility, the DragInt() code will currently parse and modify format strings to replace %*f with %d, giving time to users to upgrade their code.
                       If you have IMGUI_DISABLE_OBSOLETE_FUNCTIONS enabled, the code will instead assert! You may run a reg-exp search on your codebase for e.g. "DragInt.*%f" to help you find them.
 - 2018/04/28 (1.61) - obsoleted InputFloat() functions taking an optional "int decimal_precision" in favor of an equivalent and more flexible "const char* format",
                       consistent with other functions. Kept redirection functions (will obsolete).
 - 2018/04/09 (1.61) - IM_DELETE() helper function added in 1.60 doesn't clear the input _pointer_ reference, more consistent with expectation and allows passing r-value.
 - 2018/03/20 (1.60) - renamed io.WantMoveMouse to io.WantSetMousePos for consistency and ease of understanding (was added in 1.52, _not_ used by core and only honored by some backend ahead of merging the Nav branch).
 - 2018/03/12 (1.60) - removed ImGuiCol_CloseButton, ImGuiCol_CloseButtonActive, ImGuiCol_CloseButtonHovered as the closing cross uses regular button colors now.
 - 2018/03/08 (1.60) - changed ImFont::DisplayOffset.y to default to 0 instead of +1. Fixed rounding of Ascent/Descent to match TrueType renderer. If you were adding or subtracting to ImFont::DisplayOffset check if your fonts are correctly aligned vertically.
 - 2018/03/03 (1.60) - renamed ImGuiStyleVar_Count_ to ImGuiStyleVar_COUNT and ImGuiMouseCursor_Count_ to ImGuiMouseCursor_COUNT for consistency with other public enums.
 - 2018/02/18 (1.60) - BeginDragDropSource(): temporarily removed the optional mouse_button=0 parameter because it is not really usable in many situations at the moment.
 - 2018/02/16 (1.60) - obsoleted the io.RenderDrawListsFn callback, you can call your graphics engine render function after ImGui::Render(). Use ImGui::GetDrawData() to retrieve the ImDrawData* to display.
 - 2018/02/07 (1.60) - reorganized context handling to be more explicit,
                       - YOU NOW NEED TO CALL ImGui::CreateContext() AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR APP, AND CALL ImGui::DestroyContext() AT THE END.
                       - removed Shutdown() function, as DestroyContext() serve this purpose.
                       - you may pass a ImFontAtlas* pointer to CreateContext() to share a font atlas between contexts. Otherwise CreateContext() will create its own font atlas instance.
                       - removed allocator parameters from CreateContext(), they are now setup with SetAllocatorFunctions(), and shared by all contexts.
                       - removed the default global context and font atlas instance, which were confusing for users of DLL reloading and users of multiple contexts.
 - 2018/01/31 (1.60) - moved sample TTF files from extra_fonts/ to misc/fonts/. If you loaded files directly from the imgui repo you may need to update your paths.
 - 2018/01/11 (1.60) - obsoleted IsAnyWindowHovered() in favor of IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2018/01/11 (1.60) - obsoleted IsAnyWindowFocused() in favor of IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_AnyWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2018/01/03 (1.60) - renamed ImGuiSizeConstraintCallback to ImGuiSizeCallback, ImGuiSizeConstraintCallbackData to ImGuiSizeCallbackData.
 - 2017/12/29 (1.60) - removed CalcItemRectClosestPoint() which was weird and not really used by anyone except demo code. If you need it it's easy to replicate on your side.
 - 2017/12/24 (1.53) - renamed the emblematic ShowTestWindow() function to ShowDemoWindow(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/21 (1.53) - ImDrawList: renamed style.AntiAliasedShapes to style.AntiAliasedFill for consistency and as a way to explicitly break code that manipulate those flag at runtime. You can now manipulate ImDrawList::Flags
 - 2017/12/21 (1.53) - ImDrawList: removed 'bool anti_aliased = true' final parameter of ImDrawList::AddPolyline() and ImDrawList::AddConvexPolyFilled(). Prefer manipulating ImDrawList::Flags if you need to toggle them during the frame.
 - 2017/12/14 (1.53) - using the ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollWithMouse flag on a child window forwards the mouse wheel event to the parent window, unless either ImGuiWindowFlags_NoInputs or ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollbar are also set.
 - 2017/12/13 (1.53) - renamed GetItemsLineHeightWithSpacing() to GetFrameHeightWithSpacing(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/13 (1.53) - obsoleted IsRootWindowFocused() in favor of using IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootWindow). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
                     - obsoleted IsRootWindowOrAnyChildFocused() in favor of using IsWindowFocused(ImGuiFocusedFlags_RootAndChildWindows). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/12 (1.53) - renamed ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowOverlapMode to ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_AllowItemOverlap. Kept redirection enum (will obsolete).
 - 2017/12/10 (1.53) - removed SetNextWindowContentWidth(), prefer using SetNextWindowContentSize(). Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/11/27 (1.53) - renamed ImGuiTextBuffer::append() helper to appendf(), appendv() to appendfv(). If you copied the 'Log' demo in your code, it uses appendv() so that needs to be renamed.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style, Begin: removed ImGuiWindowFlags_ShowBorders window flag. Borders are now fully set up in the ImGuiStyle structure (see e.g. style.FrameBorderSize, style.WindowBorderSize). Use ImGui::ShowStyleEditor() to look them up.
                       Please note that the style system will keep evolving (hopefully stabilizing in Q1 2018), and so custom styles will probably subtly break over time. It is recommended you use the StyleColorsClassic(), StyleColorsDark(), StyleColorsLight() functions.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style: removed ImGuiCol_ComboBg in favor of combo boxes using ImGuiCol_PopupBg for consistency.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style: renamed ImGuiCol_ChildWindowBg to ImGuiCol_ChildBg.
 - 2017/11/18 (1.53) - Style: renamed style.ChildWindowRounding to style.ChildRounding, ImGuiStyleVar_ChildWindowRounding to ImGuiStyleVar_ChildRounding.
 - 2017/11/02 (1.53) - obsoleted IsRootWindowOrAnyChildHovered() in favor of using IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RootAndChildWindows);
 - 2017/10/24 (1.52) - renamed IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_CLIPBOARD_FUNCS/IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_IME_FUNCS to IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_CLIPBOARD_FUNCTIONS/IMGUI_DISABLE_WIN32_DEFAULT_IME_FUNCTIONS for consistency.
 - 2017/10/20 (1.52) - changed IsWindowHovered() default parameters behavior to return false if an item is active in another window (e.g. click-dragging item from another window to this window). You can use the newly introduced IsWindowHovered() flags to requests this specific behavior if you need it.
 - 2017/10/20 (1.52) - marked IsItemHoveredRect()/IsMouseHoveringWindow() as obsolete, in favor of using the newly introduced flags for IsItemHovered() and IsWindowHovered(). See https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1382 for details.
                       removed the IsItemRectHovered()/IsWindowRectHovered() names introduced in 1.51 since they were merely more consistent names for the two functions we are now obsoleting.
                         IsItemHoveredRect()        --> IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly)
                         IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow() --> IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow)
                         IsMouseHoveringWindow()    --> IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByPopup | ImGuiHoveredFlags_AllowWhenBlockedByActiveItem) [weird, old behavior]
 - 2017/10/17 (1.52) - marked the old 5-parameters version of Begin() as obsolete (still available). Use SetNextWindowSize()+Begin() instead!
 - 2017/10/11 (1.52) - renamed AlignFirstTextHeightToWidgets() to AlignTextToFramePadding(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/09/26 (1.52) - renamed ImFont::Glyph to ImFontGlyph. Kept redirection typedef (will obsolete).
 - 2017/09/25 (1.52) - removed SetNextWindowPosCenter() because SetNextWindowPos() now has the optional pivot information to do the same and more. Kept redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/25 (1.52) - io.MousePos needs to be set to ImVec2(-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX) when mouse is unavailable/missing. Previously ImVec2(-1,-1) was enough but we now accept negative mouse coordinates. In your backend if you need to support unavailable mouse, make sure to replace "io.MousePos = ImVec2(-1,-1)" with "io.MousePos = ImVec2(-FLT_MAX,-FLT_MAX)".
 - 2017/08/22 (1.51) - renamed IsItemHoveredRect() to IsItemRectHovered(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete). -> (1.52) use IsItemHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_RectOnly)!
                     - renamed IsMouseHoveringAnyWindow() to IsAnyWindowHovered() for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
                     - renamed IsMouseHoveringWindow() to IsWindowRectHovered() for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/20 (1.51) - renamed GetStyleColName() to GetStyleColorName() for consistency.
 - 2017/08/20 (1.51) - added PushStyleColor(ImGuiCol idx, ImU32 col) overload, which _might_ cause an "ambiguous call" compilation error if you are using ImColor() with implicit cast. Cast to ImU32 or ImVec4 explicily to fix.
 - 2017/08/15 (1.51) - marked the weird IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME helper macro as obsolete. prefer using the more explicit ImGuiOnceUponAFrame type.
 - 2017/08/15 (1.51) - changed parameter order for BeginPopupContextWindow() from (const char*,int buttons,bool also_over_items) to (const char*,int buttons,bool also_over_items). Note that most calls relied on default parameters completely.
 - 2017/08/13 (1.51) - renamed ImGuiCol_Column to ImGuiCol_Separator, ImGuiCol_ColumnHovered to ImGuiCol_SeparatorHovered, ImGuiCol_ColumnActive to ImGuiCol_SeparatorActive. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/11 (1.51) - renamed ImGuiSetCond_Always to ImGuiCond_Always, ImGuiSetCond_Once to ImGuiCond_Once, ImGuiSetCond_FirstUseEver to ImGuiCond_FirstUseEver, ImGuiSetCond_Appearing to ImGuiCond_Appearing. Kept redirection enums (will obsolete).
 - 2017/08/09 (1.51) - removed ValueColor() helpers, they are equivalent to calling Text(label) + SameLine() + ColorButton().
 - 2017/08/08 (1.51) - removed ColorEditMode() and ImGuiColorEditMode in favor of ImGuiColorEditFlags and parameters to the various Color*() functions. The SetColorEditOptions() allows to initialize default but the user can still change them with right-click context menu.
                     - changed prototype of 'ColorEdit4(const char* label, float col[4], bool show_alpha = true)' to 'ColorEdit4(const char* label, float col[4], ImGuiColorEditFlags flags = 0)', where passing flags = 0x01 is a safe no-op (hello dodgy backward compatibility!). - check and run the demo window, under "Color/Picker Widgets", to understand the various new options.
                     - changed prototype of rarely used 'ColorButton(ImVec4 col, bool small_height = false, bool outline_border = true)' to 'ColorButton(const char* desc_id, ImVec4 col, ImGuiColorEditFlags flags = 0, ImVec2 size = ImVec2(0, 0))'
 - 2017/07/20 (1.51) - removed IsPosHoveringAnyWindow(ImVec2), which was partly broken and misleading. ASSERT + redirect user to io.WantCaptureMouse
 - 2017/05/26 (1.50) - removed ImFontConfig::MergeGlyphCenterV in favor of a more multipurpose ImFontConfig::GlyphOffset.
 - 2017/05/01 (1.50) - renamed ImDrawList::PathFill() (rarely used directly) to ImDrawList::PathFillConvex() for clarity.
 - 2016/11/06 (1.50) - BeginChild(const char*) now applies the stack id to the provided label, consistently with other functions as it should always have been. It shouldn't affect you unless (extremely unlikely) you were appending multiple times to a same child from different locations of the stack id. If that's the case, generate an id with GetID() and use it instead of passing string to BeginChild().
 - 2016/10/15 (1.50) - avoid 'void* user_data' parameter to io.SetClipboardTextFn/io.GetClipboardTextFn pointers. We pass io.ClipboardUserData to it.
 - 2016/09/25 (1.50) - style.WindowTitleAlign is now a ImVec2 (ImGuiAlign enum was removed). set to (0.5f,0.5f) for horizontal+vertical centering, (0.0f,0.0f) for upper-left, etc.
 - 2016/07/30 (1.50) - SameLine(x) with x>0.0f is now relative to left of column/group if any, and not always to left of window. This was sort of always the intent and hopefully, breakage should be minimal.
 - 2016/05/12 (1.49) - title bar (using ImGuiCol_TitleBg/ImGuiCol_TitleBgActive colors) isn't rendered over a window background (ImGuiCol_WindowBg color) anymore.
                       If your TitleBg/TitleBgActive alpha was 1.0f or you are using the default theme it will not affect you, otherwise if <1.0f you need to tweak your custom theme to readjust for the fact that we don't draw a WindowBg background behind the title bar.
                       This helper function will convert an old TitleBg/TitleBgActive color into a new one with the same visual output, given the OLD color and the OLD WindowBg color:
                       ImVec4 ConvertTitleBgCol(const ImVec4& win_bg_col, const ImVec4& title_bg_col) { float new_a = 1.0f - ((1.0f - win_bg_col.w) * (1.0f - title_bg_col.w)), k = title_bg_col.w / new_a; return ImVec4((win_bg_col.x * win_bg_col.w + title_bg_col.x) * k, (win_bg_col.y * win_bg_col.w + title_bg_col.y) * k, (win_bg_col.z * win_bg_col.w + title_bg_col.z) * k, new_a); }
                       If this is confusing, pick the RGB value from title bar from an old screenshot and apply this as TitleBg/TitleBgActive. Or you may just create TitleBgActive from a tweaked TitleBg color.
 - 2016/05/07 (1.49) - removed confusing set of GetInternalState(), GetInternalStateSize(), SetInternalState() functions. Now using CreateContext(), DestroyContext(), GetCurrentContext(), SetCurrentContext().
 - 2016/05/02 (1.49) - renamed SetNextTreeNodeOpened() to SetNextTreeNodeOpen(), no redirection.
 - 2016/05/01 (1.49) - obsoleted old signature of CollapsingHeader(const char* label, const char* str_id = NULL, bool display_frame = true, bool default_open = false) as extra parameters were badly designed and rarely used. You can replace the "default_open = true" flag in new API with CollapsingHeader(label, ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_DefaultOpen).
 - 2016/04/26 (1.49) - changed ImDrawList::PushClipRect(ImVec4 rect) to ImDrawList::PushClipRect(Imvec2 min,ImVec2 max,bool intersect_with_current_clip_rect=false). Note that higher-level ImGui::PushClipRect() is preferable because it will clip at logic/widget level, whereas ImDrawList::PushClipRect() only affect your renderer.
 - 2016/04/03 (1.48) - removed style.WindowFillAlphaDefault setting which was redundant. Bake default BG alpha inside style.Colors[ImGuiCol_WindowBg] and all other Bg color values. (ref GitHub issue #337).
 - 2016/04/03 (1.48) - renamed ImGuiCol_TooltipBg to ImGuiCol_PopupBg, used by popups/menus and tooltips. popups/menus were previously using ImGuiCol_WindowBg. (ref github issue #337)
 - 2016/03/21 (1.48) - renamed GetWindowFont() to GetFont(), GetWindowFontSize() to GetFontSize(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2016/03/02 (1.48) - InputText() completion/history/always callbacks: if you modify the text buffer manually (without using DeleteChars()/InsertChars() helper) you need to maintain the BufTextLen field. added an assert.
 - 2016/01/23 (1.48) - fixed not honoring exact width passed to PushItemWidth(), previously it would add extra FramePadding.x*2 over that width. if you had manual pixel-perfect alignment in place it might affect you.
 - 2015/12/27 (1.48) - fixed ImDrawList::AddRect() which used to render a rectangle 1 px too large on each axis.
 - 2015/12/04 (1.47) - renamed Color() helpers to ValueColor() - dangerously named, rarely used and probably to be made obsolete.
 - 2015/08/29 (1.45) - with the addition of horizontal scrollbar we made various fixes to inconsistencies with dealing with cursor position.
                       GetCursorPos()/SetCursorPos() functions now include the scrolled amount. It shouldn't affect the majority of users, but take note that SetCursorPosX(100.0f) puts you at +100 from the starting x position which may include scrolling, not at +100 from the window left side.
                       GetContentRegionMax()/GetWindowContentRegionMin()/GetWindowContentRegionMax() functions allow include the scrolled amount. Typically those were used in cases where no scrolling would happen so it may not be a problem, but watch out!
 - 2015/08/29 (1.45) - renamed style.ScrollbarWidth to style.ScrollbarSize
 - 2015/08/05 (1.44) - split imgui.cpp into extra files: imgui_demo.cpp imgui_draw.cpp imgui_internal.h that you need to add to your project.
 - 2015/07/18 (1.44) - fixed angles in ImDrawList::PathArcTo(), PathArcToFast() (introduced in 1.43) being off by an extra PI for no justifiable reason
 - 2015/07/14 (1.43) - add new ImFontAtlas::AddFont() API. For the old AddFont***, moved the 'font_no' parameter of ImFontAtlas::AddFont** functions to the ImFontConfig structure.
                       you need to render your textured triangles with bilinear filtering to benefit from sub-pixel positioning of text.
 - 2015/07/08 (1.43) - switched rendering data to use indexed rendering. this is saving a fair amount of CPU/GPU and enables us to get anti-aliasing for a marginal cost.
                       this necessary change will break your rendering function! the fix should be very easy. sorry for that :(
                     - if you are using a vanilla copy of one of the imgui_impl_XXX.cpp provided in the example, you just need to update your copy and you can ignore the rest.
                     - the signature of the io.RenderDrawListsFn handler has changed!
                       old: ImGui_XXXX_RenderDrawLists(ImDrawList** const cmd_lists, int cmd_lists_count)
                       new: ImGui_XXXX_RenderDrawLists(ImDrawData* draw_data).
                         parameters: 'cmd_lists' becomes 'draw_data->CmdLists', 'cmd_lists_count' becomes 'draw_data->CmdListsCount'
                         ImDrawList: 'commands' becomes 'CmdBuffer', 'vtx_buffer' becomes 'VtxBuffer', 'IdxBuffer' is new.
                         ImDrawCmd:  'vtx_count' becomes 'ElemCount', 'clip_rect' becomes 'ClipRect', 'user_callback' becomes 'UserCallback', 'texture_id' becomes 'TextureId'.
                     - each ImDrawList now contains both a vertex buffer and an index buffer. For each command, render ElemCount/3 triangles using indices from the index buffer.
                     - if you REALLY cannot render indexed primitives, you can call the draw_data->DeIndexAllBuffers() method to de-index the buffers. This is slow and a waste of CPU/GPU. Prefer using indexed rendering!
                     - refer to code in the examples/ folder or ask on the GitHub if you are unsure of how to upgrade. please upgrade!
 - 2015/07/10 (1.43) - changed SameLine() parameters from int to float.
 - 2015/07/02 (1.42) - renamed SetScrollPosHere() to SetScrollFromCursorPos(). Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2015/07/02 (1.42) - renamed GetScrollPosY() to GetScrollY(). Necessary to reduce confusion along with other scrolling functions, because positions (e.g. cursor position) are not equivalent to scrolling amount.
 - 2015/06/14 (1.41) - changed ImageButton() default bg_col parameter from (0,0,0,1) (black) to (0,0,0,0) (transparent) - makes a difference when texture have transparence
 - 2015/06/14 (1.41) - changed Selectable() API from (label, selected, size) to (label, selected, flags, size). Size override should have been rarely used. Sorry!
 - 2015/05/31 (1.40) - renamed GetWindowCollapsed() to IsWindowCollapsed() for consistency. Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2015/05/31 (1.40) - renamed IsRectClipped() to IsRectVisible() for consistency. Note that return value is opposite! Kept inline redirection function (will obsolete).
 - 2015/05/27 (1.40) - removed the third 'repeat_if_held' parameter from Button() - sorry! it was rarely used and inconsistent. Use PushButtonRepeat(true) / PopButtonRepeat() to enable repeat on desired buttons.
 - 2015/05/11 (1.40) - changed BeginPopup() API, takes a string identifier instead of a bool. ImGui needs to manage the open/closed state of popups. Call OpenPopup() to actually set the "open" state of a popup. BeginPopup() returns true if the popup is opened.
 - 2015/05/03 (1.40) - removed style.AutoFitPadding, using style.WindowPadding makes more sense (the default values were already the same).
 - 2015/04/13 (1.38) - renamed IsClipped() to IsRectClipped(). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/04/09 (1.38) - renamed ImDrawList::AddArc() to ImDrawList::AddArcFast() for compatibility with future API
 - 2015/04/03 (1.38) - removed ImGuiCol_CheckHovered, ImGuiCol_CheckActive, replaced with the more general ImGuiCol_FrameBgHovered, ImGuiCol_FrameBgActive.
 - 2014/04/03 (1.38) - removed support for passing -FLT_MAX..+FLT_MAX as the range for a SliderFloat(). Use DragFloat() or Inputfloat() instead.
 - 2015/03/17 (1.36) - renamed GetItemBoxMin()/GetItemBoxMax()/IsMouseHoveringBox() to GetItemRectMin()/GetItemRectMax()/IsMouseHoveringRect(). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/03/15 (1.36) - renamed style.TreeNodeSpacing to style.IndentSpacing, ImGuiStyleVar_TreeNodeSpacing to ImGuiStyleVar_IndentSpacing
 - 2015/03/13 (1.36) - renamed GetWindowIsFocused() to IsWindowFocused(). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/03/08 (1.35) - renamed style.ScrollBarWidth to style.ScrollbarWidth (casing)
 - 2015/02/27 (1.34) - renamed OpenNextNode(bool) to SetNextTreeNodeOpened(bool, ImGuiSetCond). Kept inline redirection function until 1.50.
 - 2015/02/27 (1.34) - renamed ImGuiSetCondition_*** to ImGuiSetCond_***, and _FirstUseThisSession becomes _Once.
 - 2015/02/11 (1.32) - changed text input callback ImGuiTextEditCallback return type from void-->int. reserved for future use, return 0 for now.
 - 2015/02/10 (1.32) - renamed GetItemWidth() to CalcItemWidth() to clarify its evolving behavior
 - 2015/02/08 (1.31) - renamed GetTextLineSpacing() to GetTextLineHeightWithSpacing()
 - 2015/02/01 (1.31) - removed IO.MemReallocFn (unused)
 - 2015/01/19 (1.30) - renamed ImGuiStorage::GetIntPtr()/GetFloatPtr() to GetIntRef()/GetIntRef() because Ptr was conflicting with actual pointer storage functions.
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - big font/image API change! now loads TTF file. allow for multiple fonts. no need for a PNG loader.
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - removed GetDefaultFontData(). uses io.Fonts->GetTextureData*() API to retrieve uncompressed pixels.
                       - old:  const void* png_data; unsigned int png_size; ImGui::GetDefaultFontData(NULL, NULL, &png_data, &png_size); [..Upload texture to GPU..];
                       - new:  unsigned char* pixels; int width, height; io.Fonts->GetTexDataAsRGBA32(&pixels, &width, &height); [..Upload texture to GPU..]; io.Fonts->SetTexID(YourTexIdentifier);
                       you now have more flexibility to load multiple TTF fonts and manage the texture buffer for internal needs. It is now recommended that you sample the font texture with bilinear interpolation.
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - added texture identifier in ImDrawCmd passed to your render function (we can now render images). make sure to call io.Fonts->SetTexID()
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - removed IO.PixelCenterOffset (unnecessary, can be handled in user projection matrix)
 - 2015/01/11 (1.30) - removed ImGui::IsItemFocused() in favor of ImGui::IsItemActive() which handles all widgets
 - 2014/12/10 (1.18) - removed SetNewWindowDefaultPos() in favor of new generic API SetNextWindowPos(pos, ImGuiSetCondition_FirstUseEver)
 - 2014/11/28 (1.17) - moved IO.Font*** options to inside the IO.Font-> structure (FontYOffset, FontTexUvForWhite, FontBaseScale, FontFallbackGlyph)
 - 2014/11/26 (1.17) - reworked syntax of IMGUI_ONCE_UPON_A_FRAME helper macro to increase compiler compatibility
 - 2014/11/07 (1.15) - renamed IsHovered() to IsItemHovered()
 - 2014/10/02 (1.14) - renamed IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMGUI_USER_CPP to IMGUI_INCLUDE_IMGUI_USER_INL and imgui_user.cpp to imgui_user.inl (more IDE friendly)
 - 2014/09/25 (1.13) - removed 'text_end' parameter from IO.SetClipboardTextFn (the string is now always zero-terminated for simplicity)
 - 2014/09/24 (1.12) - renamed SetFontScale() to SetWindowFontScale()
 - 2014/09/24 (1.12) - moved IM_MALLOC/IM_REALLOC/IM_FREE preprocessor defines to IO.MemAllocFn/IO.MemReallocFn/IO.MemFreeFn
 - 2014/08/30 (1.09) - removed IO.FontHeight (now computed automatically)
 - 2014/08/30 (1.09) - moved IMGUI_FONT_TEX_UV_FOR_WHITE preprocessor define to IO.FontTexUvForWhite
 - 2014/08/28 (1.09) - changed the behavior of IO.PixelCenterOffset following various rendering fixes

 Q&A: Basics
 ===========

 Q: Where is the documentation?
 A: This library is poorly documented at the moment and expects the user to be acquainted with C/C++.
    - Run the examples/ and explore them.
    - See demo code in imgui_demo.cpp and particularly the ImGui::ShowDemoWindow() function.
    - The demo covers most features of Dear ImGui, so you can read the code and see its output.
    - See documentation and comments at the top of imgui.cpp + effectively imgui.h.
    - Dozens of standalone example applications using e.g. OpenGL/DirectX are provided in the
      examples/ folder to explain how to integrate Dear ImGui with your own engine/application.
    - The Wiki (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki) has many resources and links.
    - The Glossary (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Glossary) page also may be useful.
    - Your programming IDE is your friend, find the type or function declaration to find comments
      associated with it.

 Q: What is this library called?
 Q: Which version should I get?
 >> This library is called "Dear ImGui", please don't call it "ImGui" :)
 >> See https://www.dearimgui.org/faq for details.

 Q&A: Integration
 ================

 Q: How to get started?
 A: Read 'PROGRAMMER GUIDE' above. Read examples/README.txt.

 Q: How can I tell whether to dispatch mouse/keyboard to Dear ImGui or my application?
 A: You should read the 'io.WantCaptureMouse', 'io.WantCaptureKeyboard' and 'io.WantTextInput' flags!
 >> See https://www.dearimgui.org/faq for a fully detailed answer. You really want to read this.

 Q. How can I enable keyboard controls?
 Q: How can I use this without a mouse, without a keyboard or without a screen? (gamepad, input share, remote display)
 Q: I integrated Dear ImGui in my engine and little squares are showing instead of text...
 Q: I integrated Dear ImGui in my engine and some elements are clipping or disappearing when I move windows around...
 Q: I integrated Dear ImGui in my engine and some elements are displaying outside their expected windows boundaries...
 >> See https://www.dearimgui.org/faq

 Q&A: Usage
 ----------

 Q: About the ID Stack system..
   - Why is my widget not reacting when I click on it?
   - How can I have widgets with an empty label?
   - How can I have multiple widgets with the same label?
   - How can I have multiple windows with the same label?
 Q: How can I display an image? What is ImTextureID, how does it works?
 Q: How can I use my own math types instead of ImVec2/ImVec4?
 Q: How can I interact with standard C++ types (such as std::string and std::vector)?
 Q: How can I display custom shapes? (using low-level ImDrawList API)
 >> See https://www.dearimgui.org/faq

 Q&A: Fonts, Text
 ================

 Q: How should I handle DPI in my application?
 Q: How can I load a different font than the default?
 Q: How can I easily use icons in my application?
 Q: How can I load multiple fonts?
 Q: How can I display and input non-Latin characters such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic?
 >> See https://www.dearimgui.org/faq and https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/edit/master/docs/FONTS.md

 Q&A: Concerns
 =============

 Q: Who uses Dear ImGui?
 Q: Can you create elaborate/serious tools with Dear ImGui?
 Q: Can you reskin the look of Dear ImGui?
 Q: Why using C++ (as opposed to C)?
 >> See https://www.dearimgui.org/faq

 Q&A: Community
 ==============

 Q: How can I help?
 A: - Businesses: please reach out to "contact AT dearimgui.com" if you work in a place using Dear ImGui!
      We can discuss ways for your company to fund development via invoiced technical support, maintenance or sponsoring contacts.
      This is among the most useful thing you can do for Dear ImGui. With increased funding, we can hire more people working on this project.
    - Individuals: you can support continued development via PayPal donations. See README.
    - If you are experienced with Dear ImGui and C++, look at the GitHub issues, look at the Wiki, read docs/TODO.txt
      and see how you want to help and can help!
    - Disclose your usage of Dear ImGui via a dev blog post, a tweet, a screenshot, a mention somewhere etc.
      You may post screenshot or links in the gallery threads. Visuals are ideal as they inspire other programmers.
      But even without visuals, disclosing your use of dear imgui helps the library grow credibility, and help other teams and programmers with taking decisions.
    - If you have issues or if you need to hack into the library, even if you don't expect any support it is useful that you share your issues (on GitHub or privately).

// [SECTION] CONTEXT AND MEMORY ALLOCATORS
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// DLL users:
// - Heaps and globals are not shared across DLL boundaries!
// - You will need to call SetCurrentContext() + SetAllocatorFunctions() for each static/DLL boundary you are calling from.
// - Same applies for hot-reloading mechanisms that are reliant on reloading DLL (note that many hot-reloading mechanisms work without DLL).
// - Using Dear ImGui via a shared library is not recommended, because of function call overhead and because we don't guarantee backward nor forward ABI compatibility.
// - Confused? In a debugger: add GImGui to your watch window and notice how its value changes depending on your current location (which DLL boundary you are in).

// Current context pointer. Implicitly used by all Dear ImGui functions. Always assumed to be != NULL.
// - ImGui::CreateContext() will automatically set this pointer if it is NULL.
//   Change to a different context by calling ImGui::SetCurrentContext().
// - Important: Dear ImGui functions are not thread-safe because of this pointer.
//   If you want thread-safety to allow N threads to access N different contexts:
//   - Change this variable to use thread local storage so each thread can refer to a different context, in your imconfig.h:
//         struct ImGuiContext;
//         extern thread_local ImGuiContext* MyImGuiTLS;
//         #define GImGui MyImGuiTLS
//     And then define MyImGuiTLS in one of your cpp files. Note that thread_local is a C++11 keyword, earlier C++ uses compiler-specific keyword.
//   - Future development aims to make this context pointer explicit to all calls. Also read https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/586
//   - If you need a finite number of contexts, you may compile and use multiple instances of the ImGui code from a different namespace.
// - DLL users: read comments above.
#ifndef GImGui
ImGuiContext*   GImGui = NULL;

// Memory Allocator functions. Use SetAllocatorFunctions() to change them.
// - You probably don't want to modify that mid-program, and if you use global/static e.g. ImVector<> instances you may need to keep them accessible during program destruction.

    //   - "Q: Why is my widget not reacting when I click on it?"
    //   - "Q: How can I have widgets with an empty label?"
    //   - "Q: How can I have multiple widgets with the same label?"
    // - Short version: ID are hashes of the entire ID stack. If you are creating widgets in a loop you most likely
    //   want to push a unique identifier (e.g. object pointer, loop index) to uniquely differentiate them.
    // - You can also use the "Label##foobar" syntax within widget label to distinguish them from each others.
    // - In this header file we use the "label"/"name" terminology to denote a string that will be displayed + used as an ID,
    //   whereas "str_id" denote a string that is only used as an ID and not normally displayed.

    // - 3. Optionally call TableSetupScrollFreeze() to request scroll freezing of columns/rows.
    // - 4. Optionally call TableHeadersRow() to submit a header row. Names are pulled from TableSetupColumn() data.

    //    - In most situations you can use TableNextRow() + TableSetColumnIndex(N) to start appending into a column.

    //    - IMPORTANT: Comparatively to the old Columns() API, we need to call TableNextColumn() for the first column!

// Flags for ImGui::BeginTable()
// - Important! Sizing policies have complex and subtle side effects, much more so than you would expect.
//   Read comments/demos carefully + experiment with live demos to get acquainted with them.
// - The DEFAULT sizing policies are:
//    - Default to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedFit    if ScrollX is on, or if host window has ImGuiWindowFlags_AlwaysAutoResize.
//    - Default to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame if ScrollX is off.
// - When ScrollX is off:
//    - Table defaults to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame -> all Columns defaults to ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthStretch with same weight.
//    - Columns sizing policy allowed: Stretch (default), Fixed/Auto.
//    - Fixed Columns (if any) will generally obtain their requested width (unless the table cannot fit them all).
//    - Stretch Columns will share the remaining width according to their respective weight.
//    - Mixed Fixed/Stretch columns is possible but has various side-effects on resizing behaviors.
//      The typical use of mixing sizing policies is: any number of LEADING Fixed columns, followed by one or two TRAILING Stretch columns.
//      (this is because the visible order of columns have subtle but necessary effects on how they react to manual resizing).
// - When ScrollX is on:
//    - Table defaults to ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedFit -> all Columns defaults to ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthFixed
//    - Columns sizing policy allowed: Fixed/Auto mostly.
//    - Fixed Columns can be enlarged as needed. Table will show an horizontal scrollbar if needed.
//    - When using auto-resizing (non-resizable) fixed columns, querying the content width to use item right-alignment e.g. SetNextItemWidth(-FLT_MIN) doesn't make sense, would create a feedback loop.
//    - Using Stretch columns OFTEN DOES NOT MAKE SENSE if ScrollX is on, UNLESS you have specified a value for 'inner_width' in BeginTable().
//      If you specify a value for 'inner_width' then effectively the scrolling space is known and Stretch or mixed Fixed/Stretch columns become meaningful again.
// - Read on documentation at the top of imgui_tables.cpp for details.

// Helper: Manually clip large list of items.
// If you have lots evenly spaced items and you have a random access to the list, you can perform coarse
// clipping based on visibility to only submit items that are in view.
// The clipper calculates the range of visible items and advance the cursor to compensate for the non-visible items we have skipped.
// (Dear ImGui already clip items based on their bounds but: it needs to first layout the item to do so, and generally
//  fetching/submitting your own data incurs additional cost. Coarse clipping using ImGuiListClipper allows you to easily
//  scale using lists with tens of thousands of items without a problem)
// Usage:
//   ImGuiListClipper clipper;
//   clipper.Begin(1000);         // We have 1000 elements, evenly spaced.
//   while (clipper.Step())
//       for (int i = clipper.DisplayStart; i < clipper.DisplayEnd; i++)
//           ImGui::Text("line number %d", i);
// Generally what happens is:
// - Clipper lets you process the first element (DisplayStart = 0, DisplayEnd = 1) regardless of it being visible or not.
// - User code submit that one element.
// - Clipper can measure the height of the first element
// - Clipper calculate the actual range of elements to display based on the current clipping rectangle, position the cursor before the first visible element.
// - User code submit visible elements.
// - The clipper also handles various subtleties related to keyboard/gamepad navigation, wrapping etc.

// - Important: By default, AddFontFromMemoryTTF() takes ownership of the data. Even though we are not writing to it, we will free the pointer on destruction.
//   You can set font_cfg->FontDataOwnedByAtlas=false to keep ownership of your data and it won't be freed,
// - Even though many functions are suffixed with "TTF", OTF data is supported just as well.
// - This is an old API and it is currently awkward for those and and various other reasons! We will address them in the future!

`src/imgui/imgui_impl_dx9.cpp`:

```cpp
// dear imgui: Renderer Backend for DirectX9
// This needs to be used along with a Platform Backend (e.g. Win32)

// Implemented features:
//  [X] Renderer: User texture binding. Use 'LPDIRECT3DTEXTURE9' as ImTextureID. Read the FAQ about ImTextureID!
//  [X] Renderer: Support for large meshes (64k+ vertices) with 16-bit indices.

// You can use unmodified imgui_impl_* files in your project. See examples/ folder for examples of using this.
// Prefer including the entire imgui/ repository into your project (either as a copy or as a submodule), and only build the backends you need.
// If you are new to Dear ImGui, read documentation from the docs/ folder + read the top of imgui.cpp.
// Read online: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/docs

// CHANGELOG
// (minor and older changes stripped away, please see git history for details)
//  2021-06-29: Reorganized backend to pull data from a single structure to facilitate usage with multiple-contexts (all g_XXXX access changed to bd->XXXX).
//  2021-06-25: DirectX9: Explicitly disable texture state stages after >= 1.
//  2021-05-19: DirectX9: Replaced direct access to ImDrawCmd::TextureId with a call to ImDrawCmd::GetTexID(). (will become a requirement)
//  2021-04-23: DirectX9: Explicitly setting up more graphics states to increase compatibility with unusual non-default states.
//  2021-03-18: DirectX9: Calling IDirect3DStateBlock9::Capture() after CreateStateBlock() as a workaround for state restoring issues (see #3857).
//  2021-03-03: DirectX9: Added support for IMGUI_USE_BGRA_PACKED_COLOR in user's imconfig file.
//  2021-02-18: DirectX9: Change blending equation to preserve alpha in output buffer.
//  2019-05-29: DirectX9: Added support for large mesh (64K+ vertices), enable ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset flag.
//  2019-04-30: DirectX9: Added support for special ImDrawCallback_ResetRenderState callback to reset render state.
//  2019-03-29: Misc: Fixed erroneous assert in ImGui_ImplDX9_InvalidateDeviceObjects().
//  2019-01-16: Misc: Disabled fog before drawing UI's. Fixes issue #2288.
//  2018-11-30: Misc: Setting up io.BackendRendererName so it can be displayed in the About Window.
//  2018-06-08: Misc: Extracted imgui_impl_dx9.cpp/.h away from the old combined DX9+Win32 example.
//  2018-06-08: DirectX9: Use draw_data->DisplayPos and draw_data->DisplaySize to setup projection matrix and clipping rectangle.
//  2018-05-07: Render: Saving/restoring Transform because they don't seem to be included in the StateBlock. Setting shading mode to Gouraud.
//  2018-02-16: Misc: Obsoleted the io.RenderDrawListsFn callback and exposed ImGui_ImplDX9_RenderDrawData() in the .h file so you can call it yourself.
//  2018-02-06: Misc: Removed call to ImGui::Shutdown() which is not available from 1.60 WIP, user needs to call CreateContext/DestroyContext themselves.

//  2021-06-08: Fixed ImGui_ImplWin32_EnableDpiAwareness() and ImGui_ImplWin32_GetDpiScaleForMonitor() to handle Windows 8.1/10 features without a manifest (per-monitor DPI, and properly calls SetProcessDpiAwareness() on 8.1).
//  2021-03-23: Inputs: Clearing keyboard down array when losing focus (WM_KILLFOCUS).
//  2021-02-18: Added ImGui_ImplWin32_EnableAlphaCompositing(). Non Visual Studio users will need to link with dwmapi.lib (MinGW/gcc: use -ldwmapi).

//  2019-05-11: Inputs: Don't filter value from WM_CHAR before calling AddInputCharacter().
//  2019-01-17: Misc: Using GetForegroundWindow()+IsChild() instead of GetActiveWindow() to be compatible with windows created in a different thread or parent.
//  2019-01-17: Inputs: Added support for mouse buttons 4 and 5 via WM_XBUTTON* messages.
//  2019-01-15: Inputs: Added support for XInput gamepads (if ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad is set by user application).
//  2018-11-30: Misc: Setting up io.BackendPlatformName so it can be displayed in the About Window.
//  2018-06-29: Inputs: Added support for the ImGuiMouseCursor_Hand cursor.
//  2018-06-10: Inputs: Fixed handling of mouse wheel messages to support fine position messages (typically sent by track-pads).
//  2018-06-08: Misc: Extracted imgui_impl_win32.cpp/.h away from the old combined DX9/DX10/DX11/DX12 examples.
//  2018-03-20: Misc: Setup io.BackendFlags ImGuiBackendFlags_HasMouseCursors and ImGuiBackendFlags_HasSetMousePos flags + honor ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouseCursorChange flag.
//  2018-02-20: Inputs: Added support for mouse cursors (ImGui::GetMouseCursor() value and WM_SETCURSOR message handling).
//  2018-02-06: Inputs: Added mapping for ImGuiKey_Space.
//  2018-02-06: Inputs: Honoring the io.WantSetMousePos by repositioning the mouse (when using navigation and ImGuiConfigFlags_NavMoveMouse is set).
//  2018-02-06: Misc: Removed call to ImGui::Shutdown() which is not available from 1.60 WIP, user needs to call CreateContext/DestroyContext themselves.

// Typical tables call flow: (root level is generally public API):
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// - BeginTable()                               user begin into a table
//    | BeginChild()                            - (if ScrollX/ScrollY is set)
//    | TableBeginInitMemory()                  - first time table is used
//    | TableResetSettings()                    - on settings reset
//    | TableLoadSettings()                     - on settings load
//    | TableBeginApplyRequests()               - apply queued resizing/reordering/hiding requests
//    | - TableSetColumnWidth()                 - apply resizing width (for mouse resize, often requested by previous frame)
//    |    - TableUpdateColumnsWeightFromWidth()- recompute columns weights (of stretch columns) from their respective width
// - TableSetupColumn()                         user submit columns details (optional)
// - TableSetupScrollFreeze()                   user submit scroll freeze information (optional)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// - TableUpdateLayout() [Internal]             followup to BeginTable(): setup everything: widths, columns positions, clipping rectangles. Automatically called by the FIRST call to TableNextRow() or TableHeadersRow().
//    | TableSetupDrawChannels()                - setup ImDrawList channels
//    | TableUpdateBorders()                    - detect hovering columns for resize, ahead of contents submission
//    | TableDrawContextMenu()                  - draw right-click context menu
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// - TableHeadersRow() or TableHeader()         user submit a headers row (optional)
//    | TableSortSpecsClickColumn()             - when left-clicked: alter sort order and sort direction
//    | TableOpenContextMenu()                  - when right-clicked: trigger opening of the default context menu
// - TableGetSortSpecs()                        user queries updated sort specs (optional, generally after submitting headers)
// - TableNextRow()                             user begin into a new row (also automatically called by TableHeadersRow())
//    | TableEndRow()                           - finish existing row
//    | TableBeginRow()                         - add a new row
// - TableSetColumnIndex() / TableNextColumn()  user begin into a cell
//    | TableEndCell()                          - close existing column/cell
//    | TableBeginCell()                        - enter into current column/cell
// - [...]                                      user emit contents
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// - EndTable()                                 user ends the table
//    | TableDrawBorders()                      - draw outer borders, inner vertical borders
//    | TableMergeDrawChannels()                - merge draw channels if clipping isn't required
//    | EndChild()                              - (if ScrollX/ScrollY is set)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TABLE SIZING
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (Read carefully because this is subtle but it does make sense!)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About 'outer_size':
// Its meaning needs to differ slightly depending on if we are using ScrollX/ScrollY flags.
// Default value is ImVec2(0.0f, 0.0f).
//   X
//   - outer_size.x <= 0.0f  ->  Right-align from window/work-rect right-most edge. With -FLT_MIN or 0.0f will align exactly on right-most edge.
//   - outer_size.x  > 0.0f  ->  Set Fixed width.
//   Y with ScrollX/ScrollY disabled: we output table directly in current window
//   - outer_size.y  < 0.0f  ->  Bottom-align (but will auto extend, unless _NoHostExtendY is set). Not meaningful is parent window can vertically scroll.
//   - outer_size.y  = 0.0f  ->  No minimum height (but will auto extend, unless _NoHostExtendY is set)
//   - outer_size.y  > 0.0f  ->  Set Minimum height (but will auto extend, unless _NoHostExtenY is set)
//   Y with ScrollX/ScrollY enabled: using a child window for scrolling
//   - outer_size.y  < 0.0f  ->  Bottom-align. Not meaningful is parent window can vertically scroll.
//   - outer_size.y  = 0.0f  ->  Bottom-align, consistent with BeginChild(). Not recommended unless table is last item in parent window.
//   - outer_size.y  > 0.0f  ->  Set Exact height. Recommended when using Scrolling on any axis.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Outer size is also affected by the NoHostExtendX/NoHostExtendY flags.
// Important to that note how the two flags have slightly different behaviors!
//   - ImGuiTableFlags_NoHostExtendX -> Make outer width auto-fit to columns (overriding outer_size.x value). Only available when ScrollX/ScrollY are disabled and Stretch columns are not used.
//   - ImGuiTableFlags_NoHostExtendY -> Make outer height stop exactly at outer_size.y (prevent auto-extending table past the limit). Only available when ScrollX/ScrollY is disabled. Data below the limit will be clipped and not visible.
// In theory ImGuiTableFlags_NoHostExtendY could be the default and any non-scrolling tables with outer_size.y != 0.0f would use exact height.
// This would be consistent but perhaps less useful and more confusing (as vertically clipped items are not easily noticeable)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About 'inner_width':
//   With ScrollX disabled:
//   - inner_width          ->  *ignored*
//   With ScrollX enabled:
//   - inner_width  < 0.0f  ->  *illegal* fit in known width (right align from outer_size.x) <-- weird
//   - inner_width  = 0.0f  ->  fit in outer_width: Fixed size columns will take space they need (if avail, otherwise shrink down), Stretch columns becomes Fixed columns.
//   - inner_width  > 0.0f  ->  override scrolling width, generally to be larger than outer_size.x. Fixed column take space they need (if avail, otherwise shrink down), Stretch columns share remaining space!
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Details:
// - If you want to use Stretch columns with ScrollX, you generally need to specify 'inner_width' otherwise the concept
//   of "available space" doesn't make sense.
// - Even if not really useful, we allow 'inner_width < outer_size.x' for consistency and to facilitate understanding
//   of what the value does.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// COLUMNS SIZING POLICIES
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About overriding column sizing policy and width/weight with TableSetupColumn():
// We use a default parameter of 'init_width_or_weight == -1'.
//   - with ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthFixed,    init_width  <= 0 (default)  --> width is automatic
//   - with ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthFixed,    init_width  >  0 (explicit) --> width is custom
//   - with ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthStretch,  init_weight <= 0 (default)  --> weight is 1.0f
//   - with ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthStretch,  init_weight >  0 (explicit) --> weight is custom
// Widths are specified _without_ CellPadding. If you specify a width of 100.0f, the column will be cover (100.0f + Padding * 2.0f)
// and you can fit a 100.0f wide item in it without clipping and with full padding.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About default sizing policy (if you don't specify a ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthXXXX flag)
//   - with Table policy ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedFit      --> default Column policy is ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthFixed, default Width is equal to contents width
//   - with Table policy ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedSame     --> default Column policy is ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthFixed, default Width is max of all contents width
//   - with Table policy ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame   --> default Column policy is ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthStretch, default Weight is 1.0f
//   - with Table policy ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchWeight --> default Column policy is ImGuiTableColumnFlags_WidthStretch, default Weight is proportional to contents
// Default Width and default Weight can be overridden when calling TableSetupColumn().
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About mixing Fixed/Auto and Stretch columns together:
//   - the typical use of mixing sizing policies is: any number of LEADING Fixed columns, followed by one or two TRAILING Stretch columns.
//   - using mixed policies with ScrollX does not make much sense, as using Stretch columns with ScrollX does not make much sense in the first place!
//     that is, unless 'inner_width' is passed to BeginTable() to explicitly provide a total width to layout columns in.
//   - when using ImGuiTableFlags_SizingFixedSame with mixed columns, only the Fixed/Auto columns will match their widths to the width of the maximum contents.
//   - when using ImGuiTableFlags_SizingStretchSame with mixed columns, only the Stretch columns will match their weight/widths.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About using column width:
// If a column is manual resizable or has a width specified with TableSetupColumn():
//   - you may use GetContentRegionAvail().x to query the width available in a given column.
//   - right-side alignment features such as SetNextItemWidth(-x) or PushItemWidth(-x) will rely on this width.
// If the column is not resizable and has no width specified with TableSetupColumn():
//   - its width will be automatic and be set to the max of items submitted.
//   - therefore you generally cannot have ALL items of the columns use e.g. SetNextItemWidth(-FLT_MIN).
//   - but if the column has one or more items of known/fixed size, this will become the reference width used by SetNextItemWidth(-FLT_MIN).
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TABLES CLIPPING/CULLING
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About clipping/culling of Rows in Tables:
// - For large numbers of rows, it is recommended you use ImGuiListClipper to only submit visible rows.
//   ImGuiListClipper is reliant on the fact that rows are of equal height.
//   See 'Demo->Tables->Vertical Scrolling' or 'Demo->Tables->Advanced' for a demo of using the clipper.
// - Note that auto-resizing columns don't play well with using the clipper.
//   By default a table with _ScrollX but without _Resizable will have column auto-resize.
//   So, if you want to use the clipper, make sure to either enable _Resizable, either setup columns width explicitly with _WidthFixed.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About clipping/culling of Columns in Tables:
// - Both TableSetColumnIndex() and TableNextColumn() return true when the column is visible or performing
//   width measurements. Otherwise, you may skip submitting the contents of a cell/column, BUT ONLY if you know
//   it is not going to contribute to row height.
//   In many situations, you may skip submitting contents for every column but one (e.g. the first one).
// - Case A: column is not hidden by user, and at least partially in sight (most common case).
// - Case B: column is clipped / out of sight (because of scrolling or parent ClipRect): TableNextColumn() return false as a hint but we still allow layout output.
// - Case C: column is hidden explicitly by the user (e.g. via the context menu, or _DefaultHide column flag, etc.).
//
//                        [A]         [B]          [C]
//  TableNextColumn():    true        false        false       -> [userland] when TableNextColumn() / TableSetColumnIndex() return false, user can skip submitting items but only if the column doesn't contribute to row height.
//          SkipItems:    false       false        true        -> [internal] when SkipItems is true, most widgets will early out if submitted, resulting is no layout output.
//           ClipRect:    normal      zero-width   zero-width  -> [internal] when ClipRect is zero, ItemAdd() will return false and most widgets will early out mid-way.
//  ImDrawList output:    normal      dummy        dummy       -> [internal] when using the dummy channel, ImDrawList submissions (if any) will be wasted (because cliprect is zero-width anyway).
//
// - We need to distinguish those cases because non-hidden columns that are clipped outside of scrolling bounds should still contribute their height to the row.
//   However, in the majority of cases, the contribution to row height is the same for all columns, or the tallest cells are known by the programmer.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// About clipping/culling of whole Tables:
// - Scrolling tables with a known outer size can be clipped earlier as BeginTable() will return false.

// - We isolate headers draw commands in their own channels instead of just altering clip rects.
//   This is in order to facilitate merging of draw commands.
// - After crossing FreezeRowsCount, all columns see their current draw channel changed to a second set of channels.
// - We only use the dummy draw channel so we can push a null clipping rectangle into it without affecting other
//   channels, while simplifying per-row/per-cell overhead. It will be empty and discarded when merged.
// - We allocate 1 or 2 background draw channels. This is because we know TablePushBackgroundChannel() is only used for
//   horizontal spanning. If we allowed vertical spanning we'd need one background draw channel per merge group (1-4).
// Draw channel allocation (before merging):
// - NoClip                       --> 2+D+1 channels: bg0/1 + bg2 + foreground (same clip rect == always 1 draw call)

// When the contents of a column didn't stray off its limit, we move its channels into the corresponding group
// based on its position (within frozen rows/columns groups or not).
// At the end of the operation our 1-4 groups will each have a ImDrawCmd using the same ClipRect.
// This function assume that each column are pointing to a distinct draw channel,
// otherwise merge_group->ChannelsCount will not match set bit count of merge_group->ChannelsMask.
//
// Column channels will not be merged into one of the 1-4 groups in the following cases:
// - The contents stray off its clipping rectangle (we only compare the MaxX value, not the MinX value).
//   Direct ImDrawList calls won't be taken into account by default, if you use them make sure the ImGui:: bounds
//   matches, by e.g. calling SetCursorScreenPos().
// - The channel uses more than one draw command itself. We drop all our attempt at merging stuff here..
//   we could do better but it's going to be rare and probably not worth the hassle.
// Columns for which the draw channel(s) haven't been merged with other will use their own ImDrawCmd.

```h
// [DEAR IMGUI]
// This is a slightly modified version of stb_rect_pack.h 1.00.
// Those changes would need to be pushed into nothings/stb:
// - Added STBRP__CDECL
// Grep for [DEAR IMGUI] to find the changes.

// stb_rect_pack.h - v1.00 - public domain - rectangle packing
// Sean Barrett 2014
//
// Useful for e.g. packing rectangular textures into an atlas.
// Does not do rotation.
//
// Not necessarily the awesomest packing method, but better than
// the totally naive one in stb_truetype (which is primarily what
// this is meant to replace).
//
// Has only had a few tests run, may have issues.
//
// More docs to come.
//
// No memory allocations; uses qsort() and assert() from stdlib.
// Can override those by defining STBRP_SORT and STBRP_ASSERT.
//
// This library currently uses the Skyline Bottom-Left algorithm.
//
// Please note: better rectangle packers are welcome! Please
// implement them to the same API, but with a different init
// function.

`src/imgui/imstb_textedit.h`:

```h
// [DEAR IMGUI]
// This is a slightly modified version of stb_textedit.h 1.13.
// Those changes would need to be pushed into nothings/stb:
// - Fix in stb_textedit_discard_redo (see https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/321)
// Grep for [DEAR IMGUI] to find the changes.

// stb_textedit.h - v1.13  - public domain - Sean Barrett
// Development of this library was sponsored by RAD Game Tools
//
// This C header file implements the guts of a multi-line text-editing
// widget; you implement display, word-wrapping, and low-level string
// insertion/deletion, and stb_textedit will map user inputs into
// insertions & deletions, plus updates to the cursor position,
// selection state, and undo state.
//
// It is intended for use in games and other systems that need to build
// their own custom widgets and which do not have heavy text-editing
// requirements (this library is not recommended for use for editing large
// texts, as its performance does not scale and it has limited undo).
//
// Non-trivial behaviors are modelled after Windows text controls.
//
//
// LICENSE
//
// See end of file for license information.
//
//
// DEPENDENCIES
//
// Uses the C runtime function 'memmove', which you can override
// by defining STB_TEXTEDIT_memmove before the implementation.
// Uses no other functions. Performs no runtime allocations.

//
// USAGE
//
// This file behaves differently depending on what symbols you define
// before including it.
//
//
// Header-file mode:
//
//   If you do not define STB_TEXTEDIT_IMPLEMENTATION before including this,
//   it will operate in "header file" mode. In this mode, it declares a
//   single public symbol, STB_TexteditState, which encapsulates the current
//   state of a text widget (except for the string, which you will store
//   separately).
//
//   To compile in this mode, you must define STB_TEXTEDIT_CHARTYPE to a
//   primitive type that defines a single character (e.g. char, wchar_t, etc).
//
//   To save space or increase undo-ability, you can optionally define the
//   following things that are used by the undo system:
//
//      STB_TEXTEDIT_POSITIONTYPE         small int type encoding a valid cursor position
//      STB_TEXTEDIT_UNDOSTATECOUNT       the number of undo states to allow
//      STB_TEXTEDIT_UNDOCHARCOUNT        the number of characters to store in the undo buffer
//
//   If you don't define these, they are set to permissive types and
//   moderate sizes. The undo system does no memory allocations, so
//   it grows STB_TexteditState by the worst-case storage which is (in bytes):
//
//        [4 + 3 * sizeof(STB_TEXTEDIT_POSITIONTYPE)] * STB_TEXTEDIT_UNDOSTATE_COUNT
//      +          sizeof(STB_TEXTEDIT_CHARTYPE)      * STB_TEXTEDIT_UNDOCHAR_COUNT
//
//
// Implementation mode:
//
//   If you define STB_TEXTEDIT_IMPLEMENTATION before including this, it
//   will compile the implementation of the text edit widget, depending
//   on a large number of symbols which must be defined before the include.
//
//   The implementation is defined only as static functions. You will then
//   need to provide your own APIs in the same file which will access the
//   static functions.
//
//   The basic concept is that you provide a "string" object which
//   behaves like an array of characters. stb_textedit uses indices to
//   refer to positions in the string, implicitly representing positions
//   in the displayed textedit. This is true for both plain text and
//   rich text; even with rich text stb_truetype interacts with your
//   code as if there was an array of all the displayed characters.
//
// Symbols that must be the same in header-file and implementation mode:
//
//     STB_TEXTEDIT_CHARTYPE             the character type
//     STB_TEXTEDIT_POSITIONTYPE         small type that is a valid cursor position
//     STB_TEXTEDIT_UNDOSTATECOUNT       the number of undo states to allow
//     STB_TEXTEDIT_UNDOCHARCOUNT        the number of characters to store in the undo buffer
//
// Symbols you must define for implementation mode:
//
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_STRING               the type of object representing a string being edited,
//                                      typically this is a wrapper object with other data you need
//
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_STRINGLEN(obj)       the length of the string (ideally O(1))
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_LAYOUTROW(&r,obj,n)  returns the results of laying out a line of characters
//                                        starting from character #n (see discussion below)
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_GETWIDTH(obj,n,i)    returns the pixel delta from the xpos of the i'th character
//                                        to the xpos of the i+1'th char for a line of characters
//                                        starting at character #n (i.e. accounts for kerning
//                                        with previous char)
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_KEYTOTEXT(k)         maps a keyboard input to an insertable character
//                                        (return type is int, -1 means not valid to insert)
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_GETCHAR(obj,i)       returns the i'th character of obj, 0-based
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_NEWLINE              the character returned by _GETCHAR() we recognize
//                                        as manually wordwrapping for end-of-line positioning
//
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_DELETECHARS(obj,i,n)      delete n characters starting at i
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_INSERTCHARS(obj,i,c*,n)   insert n characters at i (pointed to by STB_TEXTEDIT_CHARTYPE*)
//
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_SHIFT       a power of two that is or'd in to a keyboard input to represent the shift key
//
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_LEFT        keyboard input to move cursor left
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_RIGHT       keyboard input to move cursor right
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_UP          keyboard input to move cursor up
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_DOWN        keyboard input to move cursor down
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_PGUP        keyboard input to move cursor up a page
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_PGDOWN      keyboard input to move cursor down a page
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_LINESTART   keyboard input to move cursor to start of line  // e.g. HOME
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_LINEEND     keyboard input to move cursor to end of line    // e.g. END
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_TEXTSTART   keyboard input to move cursor to start of text  // e.g. ctrl-HOME
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_TEXTEND     keyboard input to move cursor to end of text    // e.g. ctrl-END
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_DELETE      keyboard input to delete selection or character under cursor
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_BACKSPACE   keyboard input to delete selection or character left of cursor
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_UNDO        keyboard input to perform undo
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_REDO        keyboard input to perform redo
//
// Optional:
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_INSERT              keyboard input to toggle insert mode
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_IS_SPACE(ch)          true if character is whitespace (e.g. 'isspace'),
//                                          required for default WORDLEFT/WORDRIGHT handlers
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_MOVEWORDLEFT(obj,i)   custom handler for WORDLEFT, returns index to move cursor to
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_MOVEWORDRIGHT(obj,i)  custom handler for WORDRIGHT, returns index to move cursor to
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_WORDLEFT            keyboard input to move cursor left one word // e.g. ctrl-LEFT
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_WORDRIGHT           keyboard input to move cursor right one word // e.g. ctrl-RIGHT
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_LINESTART2          secondary keyboard input to move cursor to start of line
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_LINEEND2            secondary keyboard input to move cursor to end of line
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_TEXTSTART2          secondary keyboard input to move cursor to start of text
//    STB_TEXTEDIT_K_TEXTEND2            secondary keyboard input to move cursor to end of text
//
// Keyboard input must be encoded as a single integer value; e.g. a character code
// and some bitflags that represent shift states. to simplify the interface, SHIFT must
// be a bitflag, so we can test the shifted state of cursor movements to allow selection,
// i.e. (STB_TEXTEDIT_K_RIGHT|STB_TEXTEDIT_K_SHIFT) should be shifted right-arrow.
//
// You can encode other things, such as CONTROL or ALT, in additional bits, and
// then test for their presence in e.g. STB_TEXTEDIT_K_WORDLEFT. For example,
// my Windows implementations add an additional CONTROL bit, and an additional KEYDOWN
// bit. Then all of the STB_TEXTEDIT_K_ values bitwise-or in the KEYDOWN bit,
// and I pass both WM_KEYDOWN and WM_CHAR events to the "key" function in the
// API below. The control keys will only match WM_KEYDOWN events because of the
// keydown bit I add, and STB_TEXTEDIT_KEYTOTEXT only tests for the KEYDOWN
// bit so it only decodes WM_CHAR events.
//
// STB_TEXTEDIT_LAYOUTROW returns information about the shape of one displayed
// row of characters assuming they start on the i'th character--the width and
// the height and the number of characters consumed. This allows this library
// to traverse the entire layout incrementally. You need to compute word-wrapping
// here.
//
// Each textfield keeps its own insert mode state, which is not how normal
// applications work. To keep an app-wide insert mode, update/copy the
// "insert_mode" field of STB_TexteditState before/after calling API functions.
//
// API
//
//    void stb_textedit_initialize_state(STB_TexteditState *state, int is_single_line)
//
//    void stb_textedit_click(STB_TEXTEDIT_STRING *str, STB_TexteditState *state, float x, float y)
//    void stb_textedit_drag(STB_TEXTEDIT_STRING *str, STB_TexteditState *state, float x, float y)
//    int  stb_textedit_cut(STB_TEXTEDIT_STRING *str, STB_TexteditState *state)
//    int  stb_textedit_paste(STB_TEXTEDIT_STRING *str, STB_TexteditState *state, STB_TEXTEDIT_CHARTYPE *text, int len)
//    void stb_textedit_key(STB_TEXTEDIT_STRING *str, STB_TexteditState *state, STB_TEXEDIT_KEYTYPE key)
//
//    Each of these functions potentially updates the string and updates the
//    state.
//
//      initialize_state:
//          set the textedit state to a known good default state when initially
//          constructing the textedit.
//
//      click:
//          call this with the mouse x,y on a mouse down; it will update the cursor
//          and reset the selection start/end to the cursor point. the x,y must
//          be relative to the text widget, with (0,0) being the top left.
//
//      drag:
//          call this with the mouse x,y on a mouse drag/up; it will update the
//          cursor and the selection end point
//
//      cut:
//          call this to delete the current selection; returns true if there was
//          one. you should FIRST copy the current selection to the system paste buffer.
//          (To copy, just copy the current selection out of the string yourself.)
//
//      paste:
//          call this to paste text at the current cursor point or over the current
//          selection if there is one.
//
//      key:
//          call this for keyboard inputs sent to the textfield. you can use it
//          for "key down" events or for "translated" key events. if you need to
//          do both (as in Win32), or distinguish Unicode characters from control
//          inputs, set a high bit to distinguish the two; then you can define the
//          various definitions like STB_TEXTEDIT_K_LEFT have the is-key-event bit
//          set, and make STB_TEXTEDIT_KEYTOCHAR check that the is-key-event bit is
//          clear. STB_TEXTEDIT_KEYTYPE defaults to int, but you can #define it to
//          anything other type you wante before including.
//
//
//   When rendering, you can read the cursor position and selection state from
//   the STB_TexteditState.
//
//
// Notes:
//
// This is designed to be usable in IMGUI, so it allows for the possibility of
// running in an IMGUI that has NOT cached the multi-line layout. For this
// reason, it provides an interface that is compatible with computing the
// layout incrementally--we try to make sure we make as few passes through
// as possible. (For example, to locate the mouse pointer in the text, we
// could define functions that return the X and Y positions of characters
// and binary search Y and then X, but if we're doing dynamic layout this
// will run the layout algorithm many times, so instead we manually search
// forward in one pass. Similar logic applies to e.g. up-arrow and
// down-arrow movement.)
//
// If it's run in a widget that *has* cached the layout, then this is less
// efficient, but it's not horrible on modern computers. But you wouldn't
// want to edit million-line files with it.

```cpp
// dear imgui: FreeType font builder (used as a replacement for the stb_truetype builder)
// (code)

// Get the latest version at https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/misc/freetype
// Original code by @vuhdo (Aleksei Skriabin). Improvements by @mikesart. Maintained since 2019 by @ocornut.

// CHANGELOG
// (minor and older changes stripped away, please see git history for details)
//  2021/08/23: fixed crash when FT_Render_Glyph() fails to render a glyph and returns NULL.
//  2021/03/05: added ImGuiFreeTypeBuilderFlags_Bitmap to load bitmap glyphs.
//  2021/03/02: set 'atlas->TexPixelsUseColors = true' to help some backends with deciding of a prefered texture format.
//  2021/01/28: added support for color-layered glyphs via ImGuiFreeTypeBuilderFlags_LoadColor (require Freetype 2.10+).
//  2021/01/26: simplified integration by using '#define IMGUI_ENABLE_FREETYPE'.
//              renamed ImGuiFreeType::XXX flags to ImGuiFreeTypeBuilderFlags_XXX for consistency with other API. removed ImGuiFreeType::BuildFontAtlas().
//  2020/06/04: fix for rare case where FT_Get_Char_Index() succeed but FT_Load_Glyph() fails.
//  2019/02/09: added RasterizerFlags::Monochrome flag to disable font anti-aliasing (combine with ::MonoHinting for best results!)
//  2019/01/15: added support for imgui allocators + added FreeType only override function SetAllocatorFunctions().
//  2019/01/10: re-factored to match big update in STB builder. fixed texture height waste. fixed redundant glyphs when merging. support for glyph padding.
//  2018/06/08: added support for ImFontConfig::GlyphMinAdvanceX, GlyphMaxAdvanceX.
//  2018/02/04: moved to main imgui repository (away from http://www.github.com/ocornut/imgui_club)
//  2018/01/22: fix for addition of ImFontAtlas::TexUvscale member.
//  2017/10/22: minor inconsequential change to match change in master (removed an unnecessary statement).
//  2017/09/26: fixes for imgui internal changes.
//  2017/08/26: cleanup, optimizations, support for ImFontConfig::RasterizerFlags, ImFontConfig::RasterizerMultiply.
//  2017/08/16: imported from https://github.com/Vuhdo/imgui_freetype into http://www.github.com/ocornut/imgui_club, updated for latest changes in ImFontAtlas, minor tweaks.

// About Gamma Correct Blending:
// - FreeType assumes blending in linear space rather than gamma space.
// - See https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-base_interface.html#FT_Render_Glyph
// - For correct results you need to be using sRGB and convert to linear space in the pixel shader output.
// - The default dear imgui styles will be impacted by this change (alpha values will need tweaking).

// FIXME: cfg.OversampleH, OversampleV are not supported (but perhaps not so necessary with this rasterizer).

// [DEAR IMGUI]
// This is a slightly modified version of stb_rect_pack.h 1.00.
// Those changes would need to be pushed into nothings/stb:
// - Added STBRP__CDECL
// Grep for [DEAR IMGUI] to find the changes.

// stb_rect_pack.h - v1.00 - public domain - rectangle packing
// Sean Barrett 2014
//
// Useful for e.g. packing rectangular textures into an atlas.
// Does not do rotation.
//
// Not necessarily the awesomest packing method, but better than
// the totally naive one in stb_truetype (which is primarily what
// this is meant to replace).
//
// Has only had a few tests run, may have issues.
//
// More docs to come.
//
// No memory allocations; uses qsort() and assert() from stdlib.
// Can override those by defining STBRP_SORT and STBRP_ASSERT.
//
// This library currently uses the Skyline Bottom-Left algorithm.
//
// Please note: better rectangle packers are welcome! Please
// implement them to the same API, but with a different init
// function.
