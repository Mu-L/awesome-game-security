# Interactive IDA Plugin List

This is a comprehensive list of plugins for [IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/products/ida-pro/) that is more _interactive_, that is, it can be sorted and filtered to help with finding plugins of interest. It also has extra metadata like the language the plugin is written in, when the plugin was last updated, and an attempt at putting plugins into categories. 

The dynamic version is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://vmallet.github.io/ida-plugins). Below you can still find a standard, static version of the list.

## Contribute!

Any contribution is welcome one way or another. If you know of a plugin that could be added, or data in the list that could be updated, missing categories, typos.. please send a PR! If you'd just prefer sending me a message or an email that's fine too, my email should be pretty easy to find on GitHub.

## Credits

The original list of 200 plugins came from 
[onethawt](https://github.com/onethawt)'s excellent 
[idaplugins-list](https://github.com/onethawt/idaplugins-list). His and
other contributors' work was essential in putting together this 
interactive list.
