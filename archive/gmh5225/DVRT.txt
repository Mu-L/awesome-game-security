                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

# Dynamic Value Relocation Table (DVRT) details

For the story that led us down the rabbit hole and straight to this post (not really, we took some detours), see [How Meltdown and Spectre haunt Anti-Cheat](haunted).

### Retpoline
Retpoline changes are done ad-hoc when loading a kernel module to the memory in order to mitigate Spectre CPU vulnerabilities. Retpolines allow to replace an indirect call or jump with a sequence that has a safe speculation behavior. The question is how does the OS accomplish these changes -- how does it know where the replacements need to be applied? Where is all the information kept?

## DVRT
Dynamic Value Relocation Table (DVRT) is a metadata built into the binary during compilation phase. It's not a new format designed specifically for retpoline - it was introduced in the past, but the DVRT format was extended for the purpose of mitigating the Spectre v2. It is kept in the load config directory of the binary file.

DVRT format contains a lot of information, but for the sake of this article we will focus on just two fields:
```
uint32_t dynamicValueRelocTableOffset;
uint16_t dynamicValueRelocTableSection;
```

During the build, the compiler keeps all the metadata about indirect jumps/calls and stores them under
the `.reloc` section, repurposed for DVRT. At runtime, the kernel is parsing the DVRT data and applies
the retpoline patches for each reference kept there.
The retpoline can be enabled on OS level, using registry key `System\CurrentControlSet\Control\
Session Manager\Memory Management\FeatureSettings`. The flags responsible for retpoline are:
```
0x100 - FEATURE_SETTINGS_DISABLE_RETPOLINE
0x200 - FEATURE_SETTINGS_FORCE_ENABLE_RETPOLINE
```

The code of the retpoline sequences is stored in the `RETPOL` section of the kernel image. It is then
mapped to the page right after the end of the kernel module image (which means that this page is the
same for each image in the memory). All the replacements of the indirect calls and jumps will instead
refer to that page with retpolines -- which will execute the control flow in the way that is safe from
speculative execution attacks.

### Format
DVRT starts with the header:
```
struct ImageDynamicRelocationTable
{
    uint32_t version;
    uint32_t size;
};
```

Until now, there is only one version of the DVRT header (1). Size is of course number of bytes after the header that contains retpoline information. Then there are entries for each type of the retpoline (described further). Each block starts with the header:
```
struct ImageDynamicRelocation
{
    uint64_t symbol;
    uint32_t baseRelocSize;
};
```

Symbol field identifies one of the existing types of dynamic relocations so far (values 3, 4 and 5). Then, for each page, there is a block that starts with a relocation entry:
```
struct PEBaseRelocation
{
    uint32_t virtualAddress;
    uint32_t sizeOfBlock;
};
```

where `virtualAddress` is an address of the page for which the relocations need to be done, and
`sizeOfBlock` is size of all the entries for that page (in bytes).

After that there are entries for all of the places which need to be overwritten by the retpoline jump. The
structure used for those entries depends on the type (symbol) that was used above. There are three types
of retpoline so far. Entry for each of them will contain `pageRelativeOffset`. The kernel uses that entry to
apply the proper replacement under `virtualAddress + pageRelativeOffset` address. The rest of the
entry differs between the types of retpoline. Each of them is described below.
 
## Type 5 retpoline:
Structure:
```
union ImageSwitchtableBranchDynamicRelocation
{
    struct Parts
    {
        uint16_t pageRelativeOffset : 12;
        uint16_t registerNumber : 4;
    };
    Parts asParts;
    uint16_t asNumber;
};
```

This type is used for the indirect jumps for which the argument is put in one of the registers. The format
of the instructions for which this type applies is one of:
```
ff(e0-e7)    jmp rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, rbp, rsp
41ff(e0-e7)  jmp r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15
```
depending on the number of the register. After applying the retpoline, the modified code will look like
this:
```
e9(xxxxxxxx)    jmp <address of the retpoline page + 0xA0 + 0x20 * registerNumber>
```
Address (calculated on runtime while loading the image) will refer to the retpoline for that case. At the
retpoline page (which is the next page after the image ends), under the offset 0xA0 there is a 0x20 entry
for each of the registers -- with the proper retpoline code.

## Type 4 retpoline:
Structure:
```
union ImageIndirControlTransferDynamicRelocation
{
    struct Parts
    {
        uint16_t pageRelativeOffset : 12;
        uint16_t isCall : 1;
        uint16_t rexWPrefix : 1;
        uint16_t cfgCheck : 1;
        uint16_t reserved : 1;
    };
    
    Parts asParts;
    uint16_t asNumber;
};
```
    
PageRelativeOffset has the same role as above. Apart from that, additional parameters used:
* `isCall` - differentiate between call and jump instruction,
* `cfgCheck` - this value will be `1` if the call/jump is to the config check (which will be in a
format of the call to the pointer) or indirect call to value from `rax` register. This matters when
choosing which retpoline to use for such cases - offset in retpoline page will be `0x2A0` for
`cfgCheck == 1` and `0x2E0` for `cfgCheck == 0`,
* `rexWPrefix` - we never encountered this flag to be set yet, so this is a field for the next blog
entry :)

For example, for case with `cfgCheck == 1` and `isCall == 1` original code
```
ff15xxxxxxxx    call qword ptr ds:[<cfgCheckAddressPtr>]
```
will be replaced by
```
e8xxxxxxxx    call <address of the retpoline_page + 0x2A0>
90            nop
```

Similarly for case with with `cfgCheck == 0` and `isCall == 0` original code
```
ffe0    jmp rax    
```
will be replaced with
```
e9xxxxxxxx    jmp <address of the retpoline_page + 0x2E0>
90            nop
```

## Type 3 retpoline:
Structure:
```
union ImageImportControlTransferDynamicRelocation
{
    struct Parts
    {
        uint32_t pageRelativeOffset : 12;
        uint32_t isCall : 1;
        uint32_t iatIndex : 19;
    };
    Parts asParts;
    uint32_t asNumber;
};
```

This type is dedicated to the calls or jumps to the imported functions. Original code
```
48ff15xxxxxxxx    call qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
0f1f440000        nop dword ptr ds:[rax+rax*1], eax
```
will be replaced by
```
4c8b15xxxxxxxx    mov r10, qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
e8xxxxxxxx        call <address of the retpoline page + 0x420>
```

Since code of retpoline is unchangeable, the imported function address will be first moved to `r10`, from
which the indirect call will be performed in the retpoline code. The exact retpoline address offset in this
case is `0x420`. 

Similarly, for the jump instruction, the original code
```
48ff25xxxxxxxx    jmp qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
cccccccccc        int3
```
will be replaced by
```
4c8b15xxxxxxxx    mov r10, qword ptr ds:[<imported function address ptr>]
e9xxxxxxxx        jmp <address of the retpoline page + 0x420>
```

In some cases, when import optimization feature is enabled, instead of jumping to the retpoline, the
instruction can be replaced by jump directly to the imported function module. Import optimization (or
import linking) is another feature that can address the Spectre v2 problem without using retpoline when
certain conditions are met. It is also controllable under the registry flag
```
0x2000000 - FEATURE_SETTINGS_DISABLE_IMPORT_LINKING
```

For the cases similar to retpoline type 3, the indirect branch targeting imported function may be
replaced by calling the target directly. For this to happen, the following conditions need to be met: the
address has to be relatively close (less than 2 GB), the feature is on and the content of the IAT (import
access table) will not change after the image is loaded. This feature is used along with retpoline and can
give a significant boost to OS performance.

## Conclusion
Anti-Cheat software has to discriminate between benign and illicit modifications of the game's code. 
The operating system has always made some benign changes to apply base relocation, and to store 
import function addresses in the import address table. With the advent of side-channel mitigations, the 
Windows kernel now patches more places to redirect calls and jumps to a retpoline section to mitigate 
Spectre v2. DVRT is the structure stored in the `.reloc` section that describes these patch locations.
We have dissected and documented these novel data structures.

# How Meltdown and Spectre haunt Anti-Cheat

## Abstract
Puzzled by our observation of modified versions of Windows kernel components seen in the wild, we started to research the origins of these modifications. What we discovered are the artifacts of mitigations for well-known CPU side-channel vulnerabilities. In this article, we have a closer look at these potential attacks and how they are addressed by the Windows operating system. Finally, we discover and document the mechanics used in Windows executable files to help apply the mitigations, and point out that their understanding is crucial for an Anti-Cheat solution.

## Introduction
One of the tactics widely used by cheaters in multiplayer games is modifying the software loaded into memory by overwriting the original code of the process, or by injecting their own code. This can give them advantage in many ways -- they can modify the code of the game itself to overcome the obstacles that other players have to deal with (i.e. seeing enemies through walls or gain infinite amount of health). They can also modify third party software (e.g. the keyboard or mouse driver) in order to emulate input. One of the biggest challenges of anti-cheat software is to detect such modifications and to justify whether they are a cheat or just expected variations. But what happens if the operating system itself starts to modify the code while loading it into memory, and is doing it outwardly in a quite unpredictable way?

Few types of such intended modifications can be observed in Windows family systems since 2019 as a way of mitigating [Spectre and Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/) attacks. Those attacks, firstly described in 2018 are exploits that compromise the hardware security features of modern processors as they were at the time. Both of them are side channel attacks that, basing on modern CPU features, like out-of-order and speculative execution, making it possible for one processes to reach the memory reserved for another process (Spectre) or to the kernel memory itself (Meltdown).

## Background
But how are these attacks even possible? First of all we need to dig into the optimization techniques that are standard for modern CPUs.

### Pipelining
Every simple CPU instruction consists of the sequence of elementary operations, often 5 pipeline stages are assumed. First, the instruction needs to be fetched from the address pointed out by the instruction counter, then it needs to be decoded. After that, the actual arithmetical or logical operation may be executed (e.g. adding two numbers). The next step would be to write the result to the given register, and finally increment the instruction counter. To process each of the instructions sequentially would be a waste of time and resources - the actual arithmetical operation would be performed only during one of those steps, making the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) idle for the remaining four pipeline stages. Instead of the sequential execution of each instruction, processors reach for the next instruction as soon as the first step of the previous one was performed. That way many instructions may be performed in parallel, each one being at a different step of the pipeline at a given time. On modern CPUs there can be up to 100 instructions in flight in the pipeline.

### Out of order execution
As long as it's safe from the logical point of view, processors can switch the order of the instructions that are currently in the pipeline. Let's say that one of the instructions that is on the top of the pipeline needs to wait for data from the memory (not cached anywhere yet) in order to be finished. The process may execute the instructions that are later in the pipeline, but for which the data is already present, and move the execution of the previous instruction to the moment when the data will be available for it as well.

### Branch prediction
Usually the jump instructions are conditional and based on the result of the previous instruction. When both of these instructions are in the pipeline, there is no way for the processor to decide which instruction should be loaded to the memory next (the one after the jump is performed or the one at the jump target). Normally such situation would cause another delay in pipelining - until the moment when the result of the first instruction is known. Branch prediction technique tries to execute the more probable path based on the data from previous executions of that step. Yet the prediction may turn out to be wrong, which leads us to...

### Speculative execution
When proceeding with one or the other branch path, according to the decision made by branch prediction algorithm, the CPU makes a snapshot of the current state of itself. In the moment when the condition of the jump is known, processor can either continue with the execution (if the branch prediction was right) or discard all the instructions and restore the processor state according to the taken snapshot from before the jump (if the branch prediction was wrong). Speculative execution does not influence the state of the memory or disc - only the state of the CPU (its registers) can be changed. This way executing the wrong branch can be unrolled safely.

### Side channel attack
Spectre and Meltdown attacks are side channel attacks. It's a kind of attack that does not base on vulnerability of the algorithm, but instead tries to gain the confidential data using the meta information that can be gained from the technology used to implement the algorithm - in this case, the processor itself. One common examples of such attack is compromising comparing an input string with a password. If the algorithms compares one letter after another, the cheater is able to say how many first letters of the input string are matching the password, based on the time of the comparison – a timing side channel. Another kind of the side channel attack is any attack that tries to speculate over the content of the cache. By measuring the time for reaching a specific address in memory, the attacker is able to decide whether the content of that memory address is cached or not. 

## Performing the attack

### Meltdown
Meltdown is an attack that allows a user space process to reach the kernel address space content without any permissions to do so. Address space separation is assured at the hardware level – an instruction reaching for the kernel address space raises an exception that immediately prevents the data leak. In parallel to translating the address which the process want to reach, the processor checks the permission bits for that address to verify whether the process can have access to that address. If the permissions are insufficient, an exception will be thrown and the data won't be reached. This is perfectly safe for a processor that processes instructions sequentially and in given order. But due to pipelining and speculative execution, instructions that reach the forbidden kernel space are executed even though the user has no permission. Moreover, reaching the data and checking the permission are done independently. Of course the processor eventually will determine that such data requires higher permissions and will raise the exception -- but the data from kernel memory was already reached and put into one of the registers. Even though the processor state will be restored with the snapshot from before the execution of the feral instruction, the attacker can use the small window between getting the data and rejecting it, employing a cache attack.

### Spectre v1
Spectre does not break the user/kernel space barrier -- instead, it allows one process to reach the memory assigned to another process. This is possible by specific training the branch predictor in a way that it allows to execute (speculatively) the instruction that should never be reached in the regular flow. Common example is checking the index of the array before reaching the cell under that index. Even if the index is beyond the array size, and given the branch predictor is trained to execute the incorrect path, the data from outside the array will be reached, and for the moment will be available. To make use of that value before it will be rejected, in both Spectre and Meltdown, the cheater can use the probe array and timing attack to receive that value.

### Spectre v2
Second variant of the Spectre relies on exploiting the branch target predictor. Attacker may mistrain the branch target predictor in order to choose the indirect jump to the part of the memory where the malicious code is present. The code then access the sensitive data and buffers it in the way that it is possible to obtain it later. The rest of the attack is the same -- the speculative execution will be rejected, but the cache can be affected after that and using a cache attack, the attacker is able to obtain sensitive data.

### Cache attack
Even though the value from the forbidden part of the memory is reached and available in the register, it will be soon zeroed by the CPU at the moment when the speculative execution is rejected. To try to obtain this value, the attacker has to flush the cache totally, so that no previously stored data would affect the attack. Then the attacker can use the sensitive value as an index for the probe array, and reach for that index. The value from the probe array (for which the attacker has permissions) will be cached. Then, the attacker can perform a time attack on that cache and see for which of the indices the time of reading the value will be the shortest. This will reveal the forbidden value to the attacker.

## How to protect from those attacks?
There are several possibilities of mitigating the Spectre and meltdown attacks. Some of them were provided by the CPU manufacturers and were possible due to microcode updates. Depending on the type of the attack, a different approach was made. For example, for Spectre variant 1 sufficient solution is to add the [LFENCE](https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_155.html) instruction. Such instruction stops speculative execution until the previous instructions are completed (retired). For meltdown, one of the possible solutions is Kernel Page Table Isolation ([KPTI](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/pti.html)) (not in the scope of this article).

Yet for the Spectre variant 2 there is a huge performance problem. The solutions that were provided rely on limiting the branch target predictor. For example, indirect branch predictor barrier ([IBPB](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/indirect-branch-predictor-barrier.html)) flushes the content of the branch predictors which prevents the predictions based on previously ran software to influence the current one. Single Thread Indirect Branch Predictor ([STIBP](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/single-thread-indirect-branch-predictors.html)) restricts sharing the branch predictor data to a single physical core only. These approaches heavily impact the performance of the software, any may be unacceptable, especially in gaming industry. One of the most promising solutions is to implement the retpoline mechanism on the operating system level.

### What is retpoline?
Retpoline is a simple mechanism provided by Google engineers that allows to replace an indirect call or jump with a sequence that has a safe speculation behavior. A potentially unsafe indirect call is overwritten by a jump to that safe isolated space, followed by an interrupt (that breaks the speculative injection). In the isolated snippet below, the return address on the stack is overwritten by the desired address of the indirect call, followed by a return instruction.

So in the example 
([taken from 'Mitigating Spectre variant 2 with Retpoline on Windows'](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals-blog/mitigating-spectre-variant-2-with-retpoline-on-windows/ba-p/295618)) for one of the types of retpoline code
```
call <Jump Target>
```

will be replaced by

```
RP0:  call RP2; push address of RP1 onto the stack and jump to RP2
RP1:  int 3   ; breakpoint to capture speculation
...
RP2:  mov [rsp], <Jump Target>; overwrite return address on the stack
```

to desired target

```
RP3:  ret; return
```


### How it's done
Retpoline changes are done ad-hoc when loading a kernel module to the memory. The question is how
does the OS accomplish these changes -- how does it know where the replacements need to be applied?
Where is all the information kept?

## Outlook
The answer is the Dynamic Value Relocation Table (DVRT), to be found via the *load config* directory of a Windows PE32 binary file. We will take a closer look in a [follow-up post](dvrt).
