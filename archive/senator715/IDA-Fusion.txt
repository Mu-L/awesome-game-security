      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# IDA-Fusion
**IDA-Fusion** is an **ULTRA fast** signature scanner and creator for IDA Pro versions 7 and 8+, powered by GCC.

---

## Why Choose IDA-Fusion?
IDA-Fusion was developed to address the lack of stable and reliable signature scanners and creators available for IDA. Most existing solutions are riddled with bugs, generate non-unique signatures, and struggle with binaries that employ anti-reverse engineering techniques, such as duplicated binary parts.

**IDA-Fusion** stands apart because it is:

- **GCC-Powered**: Built with GCC for reliability and compatibility.
- **Optimized and Fast**: Efficient algorithms for signature creation and scanning, quickly handling large binaries.
- **Compact and Unique**: Keeps signatures small without sacrificing uniqueness.
- **Versatile**: Supports IDA-style, code-style, CRC-32, and FNV1-A signature generation.
- **User-Friendly**: Auto-jumps to matches, copies signatures to clipboard, and keeps things streamlined.

---

## How Does IDA-Fusion Create Signatures?
IDA-Fusion operates by wildcarding any operand that contains an **immediate value (IMM)**. For example, the instruction `lea rax, [rbx+10h]` is converted into the signature `lea rax, [rbx+?]`. This approach differs significantly from traditional signature creators, as it ensures that only the **opcodes** are captured, making IDA-Fusion especially effective for programs designed to resist signature creation.

![Signature Creation Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89423559/170587870-133ff3c1-e95a-4a20-a9ca-deb1390cbd40.png)

In the image above, the highlighted portion shows what is omitted when creating a signature. By focusing solely on opcodes, IDA-Fusion produces more reliable signatures, especially for binaries that employ anti-signature measures.

---

## What's Next for IDA-Fusion?
We're committed to enhancing and optimizing IDA-Fusion with new features and performance improvements. We're also open to contributions from the community. Some planned future features include:

- **Reverse Searching**: Create even smaller signatures by analyzing from the end (optional feature).
- **Reference-Based Signatures**: Generate signatures based on references (optional feature).
- **More Features**: We're continuously brainstorming additional features to enhance IDA-Fusion.

---

## Requirements
- **IDA Pro Version 7.5 or Above**

---

## Installation

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Get the latest [Release here](https://github.com/senator715/IDA-Fusion/releases), or compile it yourself.
2. **Copy Plugin Files**: Drag `fusion.dll` and `fusion64.dll` into your IDA installation's `plugins` folder.
3. **Access the Fusion Menu**: Use `Edit > Plugins > Fusion` or press `CTRL + ALT + S` to open the action menu.

---

## Compilation Instructions

1. **Download GCC**: Install GCC, preferably using MSYS2.
2. **Extract SDK**: Extract the contents of IDA's `idasdk7.x.zip` into the `sdk` folder within IDA-Fusion.
3. **Modify Copy Directories**: To avoid confusion, update the copy directories in `compile.bat`.
4. **Run the Compilation Script**: Run `compile.bat` to compile IDA-Fusion for both x86 and x64 versions of IDA.

---

## Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions! Whether it's a new feature, bug fix, or advice, your help is greatly appreciated. Join us in making IDA-Fusion even better.

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement. Happy reversing!
