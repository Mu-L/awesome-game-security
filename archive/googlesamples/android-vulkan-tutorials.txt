# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA]
    (http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA]
    (http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.

## Contributing a Patch

1. Sign a Contributor License Agreement, if you have not yet done so (see
   details above).
1. Create your change to the repo in question.
    * Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
    * Ensure that your code is clear and comprehensible.
    * Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
1. Submit a pull request.
1. The repo owner will review your request. If it is approved, the change will
   be merged. If it needs additional work, the repo owner will respond with
   useful comments.

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

Tutorial Samples
================
A set of samples to illustrate Vulkan API on Android with Android Studio		
To build on windows for tutorial02/03, copy/install ndk-r12 ( or better ) to a directory close to root dir ( C: ) to workaround command path 260 character limit issue; see tutorial02/03's build.gradle for details. To Build samples:
- Inside Andriod, menu File --> New --> Import Project
- Find your sample's build.gradle and open it
This will force andrioid studio to create local.properties file to config your SDK and NDK location; if you see error during importing, open local.properties file and correct the NDK and SDK location, then re-sync.

Other Resources:	
Additional Android Studio/NDK samples:    
- [Android Vulkan API Basic Samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/vulkan-basic-samples)
- [Google Play Game Samples](https://github.com/playgameservices/cpp-android-basic-samples)
- [Google Android NDK Samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk)

Contents
-------------
- [Tutorial 1 - Load Vulkan](./tutorial01_load_vulkan)
  - create a vulkan device
- [Tutorial 2 - Prebuilt Layers](./tutorial02_prebuild_layers)
  - create a vulkan device with vulkan validation layers
- [Tutorial 3 - Traceable Layers](./tutorial03_traceable_layers)
  - create a vulkan device with validation layers that could be traced.
Refer to README.md under its directory
- [Tutorial 4 - First Window](./tutorial04_first_window)
  - create a vulkan window with WSI 
- [Tutoiral 5 - Triangle](./tutorial05_triangle)
  - draw a simple triangle with Android Studio integrated shaderc feature
- [Tutorial 6 - Texture](./tutorial06_texture)
  - draw textured triangle with [CDep](https://github.com/google/cdep) packed shaderc pre-built binary
  - glsl shaders are compiled at app run time (similar to openGL traditional shader compiling model)

Pre-requisites
--------------
- A device running Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher
- [Android Studio 3.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) or higher
- Android NDK
    * [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html)
    * SDK with the latest cmake package

Test Matrix
------------
| Andrid Studio Version | cmake in SDK| NDK      | device  |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 3.0.0                 | 3.6.4111459 | NDK-r16  | Pixel XL|

   You can #define STBI_ASSERT(x) before the #include to avoid using assert.h.
   And #define STBI_MALLOC, STBI_REALLOC, and STBI_FREE to avoid using malloc,realloc,free


   QUICK NOTES:
      Primarily of interest to game developers and other people who can
          avoid problematic images and only need the trivial interface

      JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib)
      PNG 1/2/4/8-bit-per-channel (16 bpc not supported)

      TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
      BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
      PSD (composited view only, no extra channels, 8/16 bit-per-channel)

      GIF (*comp always reports as 4-channel)
      HDR (radiance rgbE format)
      PIC (Softimage PIC)
      PNM (PPM and PGM binary only)

      Animated GIF still needs a proper API, but here's one way to do it:
          http://gist.github.com/urraka/685d9a6340b26b830d49

      - decode from memory or through FILE (define STBI_NO_STDIO to remove code)
      - decode from arbitrary I/O callbacks
      - SIMD acceleration on x86/x64 (SSE2) and ARM (NEON)

   Full documentation under "DOCUMENTATION" below.


   Revision 2.00 release notes:

      - Progressive JPEG is now supported.

      - PPM and PGM binary formats are now supported, thanks to Ken Miller.

      - x86 platforms now make use of SSE2 SIMD instructions for
        JPEG decoding, and ARM platforms can use NEON SIMD if requested.
        This work was done by Fabian "ryg" Giesen. SSE2 is used by
        default, but NEON must be enabled explicitly; see docs.

        With other JPEG optimizations included in this version, we see
        2x speedup on a JPEG on an x86 machine, and a 1.5x speedup
        on a JPEG on an ARM machine, relative to previous versions of this
        library. The same results will not obtain for all JPGs and for all
        x86/ARM machines. (Note that progressive JPEGs are significantly
        slower to decode than regular JPEGs.) This doesn't mean that this
        is the fastest JPEG decoder in the land; rather, it brings it
        closer to parity with standard libraries. If you want the fastest
        decode, look elsewhere. (See "Philosophy" section of docs below.)

        See final bullet items below for more info on SIMD.

      - Added STBI_MALLOC, STBI_REALLOC, and STBI_FREE macros for replacing
        the memory allocator. Unlike other STBI libraries, these macros don't
        support a context parameter, so if you need to pass a context in to
        the allocator, you'll have to store it in a global or a thread-local
        variable.

      - Split existing STBI_NO_HDR flag into two flags, STBI_NO_HDR and
        STBI_NO_LINEAR.
            STBI_NO_HDR:     suppress implementation of .hdr reader format
            STBI_NO_LINEAR:  suppress high-dynamic-range light-linear float API

      - You can suppress implementation of any of the decoders to reduce
        your code footprint by #defining one or more of the following
        symbols before creating the implementation.

            STBI_NO_JPEG
            STBI_NO_PNG
            STBI_NO_BMP
            STBI_NO_PSD
            STBI_NO_TGA
            STBI_NO_GIF
            STBI_NO_HDR
            STBI_NO_PIC
            STBI_NO_PNM   (.ppm and .pgm)

      - You can request *only* certain decoders and suppress all other ones
        (this will be more forward-compatible, as addition of new decoders
        doesn't require you to disable them explicitly):

            STBI_ONLY_JPEG
            STBI_ONLY_PNG
            STBI_ONLY_BMP
            STBI_ONLY_PSD
            STBI_ONLY_TGA
            STBI_ONLY_GIF
            STBI_ONLY_HDR
            STBI_ONLY_PIC
            STBI_ONLY_PNM   (.ppm and .pgm)

         Note that you can define multiples of these, and you will get all
         of them ("only x" and "only y" is interpreted to mean "only x&y").

       - If you use STBI_NO_PNG (or _ONLY_ without PNG), and you still
         want the zlib decoder to be available, #define STBI_SUPPORT_ZLIB

      - Compilation of all SIMD code can be suppressed with
            #define STBI_NO_SIMD
        It should not be necessary to disable SIMD unless you have issues
        compiling (e.g. using an x86 compiler which doesn't support SSE
        intrinsics or that doesn't support the method used to detect
        SSE2 support at run-time), and even those can be reported as
        bugs so I can refine the built-in compile-time checking to be
        smarter.

      - The old STBI_SIMD system which allowed installing a user-defined
        IDCT etc. has been removed. If you need this, don't upgrade. My
        assumption is that almost nobody was doing this, and those who
        were will find the built-in SIMD more satisfactory anyway.

      - RGB values computed for JPEG images are slightly different from
        previous versions of stb_image. (This is due to using less
        integer precision in SIMD.) The C code has been adjusted so
        that the same RGB values will be computed regardless of whether
        SIMD support is available, so your app should always produce
        consistent results. But these results are slightly different from
        previous versions. (Specifically, about 3% of available YCbCr values
        will compute different RGB results from pre-1.49 versions by +-1;
        most of the deviating values are one smaller in the G channel.)

      - If you must produce consistent results with previous versions of
        stb_image, #define STBI_JPEG_OLD and you will get the same results
        you used to; however, you will not get the SIMD speedups for
        the YCbCr-to-RGB conversion step (although you should still see
        significant JPEG speedup from the other changes).

        Please note that STBI_JPEG_OLD is a temporary feature; it will be
        removed in future versions of the library. It is only intended for
        near-term back-compatibility use.

#define STBI_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE_H

// DOCUMENTATION
//
// Limitations:
//    - no 16-bit-per-channel PNG
//    - no 12-bit-per-channel JPEG
//    - no JPEGs with arithmetic coding
//    - no 1-bit BMP
//    - GIF always returns *comp=4
//
// Basic usage (see HDR discussion below for HDR usage):
//    int x,y,n;
//    unsigned char *data = stbi_load(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);
//    // ... process data if not NULL ...
//    // ... x = width, y = height, n = # 8-bit components per pixel ...
//    // ... replace '0' with '1'..'4' to force that many components per pixel
//    // ... but 'n' will always be the number that it would have been if you said 0
//    stbi_image_free(data)
//
// Standard parameters:
//    int *x       -- outputs image width in pixels
//    int *y       -- outputs image height in pixels
//    int *comp    -- outputs # of image components in image file
//    int req_comp -- if non-zero, # of image components requested in result
//
// The return value from an image loader is an 'unsigned char *' which points
// to the pixel data, or NULL on an allocation failure or if the image is
// corrupt or invalid. The pixel data consists of *y scanlines of *x pixels,
// with each pixel consisting of N interleaved 8-bit components; the first
// pixel pointed to is top-left-most in the image. There is no padding between
// image scanlines or between pixels, regardless of format. The number of
// components N is 'req_comp' if req_comp is non-zero, or *comp otherwise.
// If req_comp is non-zero, *comp has the number of components that _would_
// have been output otherwise. E.g. if you set req_comp to 4, you will always
// get RGBA output, but you can check *comp to see if it's trivially opaque
// because e.g. there were only 3 channels in the source image.
//
// An output image with N components has the following components interleaved
// in this order in each pixel:
//
//     N=#comp     components
//       1           grey
//       2           grey, alpha
//       3           red, green, blue
//       4           red, green, blue, alpha
//
// If image loading fails for any reason, the return value will be NULL,
// and *x, *y, *comp will be unchanged. The function stbi_failure_reason()
// can be queried for an extremely brief, end-user unfriendly explanation
// of why the load failed. Define STBI_NO_FAILURE_STRINGS to avoid
// compiling these strings at all, and STBI_FAILURE_USERMSG to get slightly
// more user-friendly ones.
//
// Paletted PNG, BMP, GIF, and PIC images are automatically depalettized.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// Philosophy
//
// stb libraries are designed with the following priorities:
//
//    1. easy to use
//    2. easy to maintain
//    3. good performance
//
// Sometimes I let "good performance" creep up in priority over "easy to maintain",
// and for best performance I may provide less-easy-to-use APIs that give higher
// performance, in addition to the easy to use ones. Nevertheless, it's important
// to keep in mind that from the standpoint of you, a client of this library,
// all you care about is #1 and #3, and stb libraries do not emphasize #3 above all.
//
// Some secondary priorities arise directly from the first two, some of which
// make more explicit reasons why performance can't be emphasized.
//
//    - Portable ("ease of use")
//    - Small footprint ("easy to maintain")
//    - No dependencies ("ease of use")
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// I/O callbacks
//
// I/O callbacks allow you to read from arbitrary sources, like packaged
// files or some other source. Data read from callbacks are processed
// through a small internal buffer (currently 128 bytes) to try to reduce
// overhead.
//
// The three functions you must define are "read" (reads some bytes of data),
// "skip" (skips some bytes of data), "eof" (reports if the stream is at the end).
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// SIMD support
//
// The JPEG decoder will try to automatically use SIMD kernels on x86 when
// supported by the compiler. For ARM Neon support, you must explicitly
// request it.
//
// (The old do-it-yourself SIMD API is no longer supported in the current
// code.)
//
// On x86, SSE2 will automatically be used when available based on a run-time
// test; if not, the generic C versions are used as a fall-back. On ARM targets,
// the typical path is to have separate builds for NEON and non-NEON devices
// (at least this is true for iOS and Android). Therefore, the NEON support is
// toggled by a build flag: define STBI_NEON to get NEON loops.
//
// The output of the JPEG decoder is slightly different from versions where
// SIMD support was introduced (that is, for versions before 1.49). The
// difference is only +-1 in the 8-bit RGB channels, and only on a small
// fraction of pixels. You can force the pre-1.49 behavior by defining
// STBI_JPEG_OLD, but this will disable some of the SIMD decoding path
// and hence cost some performance.
//
// If for some reason you do not want to use any of SIMD code, or if
// you have issues compiling it, you can disable it entirely by
// defining STBI_NO_SIMD.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// HDR image support   (disable by defining STBI_NO_HDR)
//
// stb_image now supports loading HDR images in general, and currently
// the Radiance .HDR file format, although the support is provided
// generically. You can still load any file through the existing interface;
// if you attempt to load an HDR file, it will be automatically remapped to
// LDR, assuming gamma 2.2 and an arbitrary scale factor defaulting to 1;
// both of these constants can be reconfigured through this interface:
//
//     stbi_hdr_to_ldr_gamma(2.2f);
//     stbi_hdr_to_ldr_scale(1.0f);
//
// (note, do not use _inverse_ constants; stbi_image will invert them
// appropriately).
//
// Additionally, there is a new, parallel interface for loading files as
// (linear) floats to preserve the full dynamic range:
//
//    float *data = stbi_loadf(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);

//
// Finally, given a filename (or an open file or memory block--see header

// iPhone PNG support:
//
// By default we convert iphone-formatted PNGs back to RGB, even though
// they are internally encoded differently. You can disable this conversion
// by by calling stbi_convert_iphone_png_to_rgb(0), in which case
// you will always just get the native iphone "format" through (which
// is BGR stored in RGB).
//
// Call stbi_set_unpremultiply_on_load(1) as well to force a divide per
// pixel to remove any premultiplied alpha *only* if the image file explicitly
// says there's premultiplied data (currently only happens in iPhone images,
// and only if iPhone convert-to-rgb processing is on).

# Tutorial 02 - use validation layers - 1

Demonstrate how to use validation layers prebuilt from [Validation layer repo][1]

## Pre-requirement:
---------------
1. Download prebuilt validation layer android-binaries-*.zip from [Khronos repo][1]
1. unzip to $this-project-root/vvl-libs

## Added steps from previous example
1. Use vulkan wrappers in common/vulkan_wrapper directory.
1. Add the validation layer into gradle build to pack it into apk.
1. (Optional but nice to have)Confirm the validation layer "VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation" is available with `vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties()`. 
1. Enable the validation layer and "VK_EXT_debug_report" when creating instance.
1. Register debug callback implemented in "VK_EXT_debug_report" with vkCreateDebugReportCallbackEXT(). Note that application could also use "VK_EXT_debug_utils" implemented in the validatio layer.

# Verification
Planted error: this sample sets [`VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo::pQueuePriorities`][2](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vulkan-tutorials/blob/master/tutorial02_prebuild_layers/app/src/main/jni/main.cpp#L190) to nullptr,
which will trigger validation layers to notify us from registered callback function
`vkDebugReportCallbackEX_impl();` putting a breakpoint with Android Studio, observe
the breakpoint being triggered.

In logcat, you would see the error message like:
```
E/Vulkan-Debug-Message:: Validation -- Validation Error: [ VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-pQueuePriorities-parameter ] Object 0: VK_NULL_HANDLE, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_DEVICE; | MessageID = 0xd6d720c6 | vkCreateDevice: required parameter pCreateInfo->pQueueCreateInfos[0].pQueuePriorities specified as NULL. The Vulkan spec states: pQueuePriorities must be a valid pointer to an array of queueCount float values (https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VUID-VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo-pQueuePriorities-parameter)
```

# Tutorial 03 - traceable_layers
This has the same functionality as [Tutorial 2](../tutorial02_prebuild_layers), but building the validation layers
from the Khronos Group Validation Layer source code hosted on [the github repo](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers.git).
The benefit is:
- you could trace into validation layers.
- you could observe the detailed status when validation layer finds issues in your app.

Validation layers are stable now, this should be a good help to developers who likge to know
more about validation layers inside.

# Background
Layer source status:
- For NDK version <= r21, there are multiple layers for Android; NDK keeps a snapshot of layer source code and the binaries
- For NDK22 layers are consolidated into one layer: VkLayer_khronos_validation; NDK keeps a snapshot of layer source code and the binary
- For NDK version >= r23, layer source and binary are not available anymore.

We recommend developers to get the validation layer source and binary releases directly from
[the github repo](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers.git).


# Build Instructions
In this sample, the validation layers is wrapped into a gradle library module called "layerlib", it is a dependent module to application
code(to force it build before app).The validation layer source code needs to be pulled in on command line before building the sample:
1. cd tutorial03_traceable_layers/layerlib
2. git clone --recursive https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers.git
3. cd Vulkan-ValidationLayers/build-android
4. ./update_external_sources_android.sh --no-build
    (use the update_external_sources_android.bat for Windows OS)
5. Now, at this point, open this sample with Android Studio with "Open an Existing Project" option
6. Build the project, and start debugging(Run > Debug App). It takes about 20 minutes to build layers, so be patient

Once app triggers validation layer assert(embedded on purpose inside this sample in the app), you could see the stack frames
inside Studio IDE., inside the debug window, you would see all validation layer variables when the app error is validated.

This sample is not tested on windows, it should work.

## future work
- Automically pull the source code automatically in gradle, but gradle's 'ndkBuild path' is evaluated before source code pulling,
hence errors out, need help to get it done.
- automatically run update_external_sources_android.sh. probably needs a gradle task to do it.
