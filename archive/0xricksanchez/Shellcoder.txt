      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# BinaryNinja Shellcoder Plugin

## Overview

Shellcoder is a lightweight plugin for Binary Ninja that enhances shellcode development and analysis.
It provides a versatile interface for assembling, disassembling, and formatting shellcode, supporting multiple architectures and output formats akin to the online ShellStorm Assembler/Disassembler.

## Features

- **Multi-architecture Support**: Compatible with all architectures supported by Binary Ninja.
- **Flexible Input Formats**:
  - Assembly instructions
  - Inline hex format (e.g., "\x90\x90")
  - Space-separated hex format (e.g., 90 90)
- **Multiple Output Formats**:
  - Inline hex
  - Space-separated hex
  - Python byte string
  - C-style array
  - Disassembled mnemonics (for disassembling)
- **Customizable Mnemonic Display**:
  - Optional address display
  - Optional bytecode display
  - Adjustable base address for relative operations
- **Comment usage**:
  - You can annotate your assembly/shellcode with comments (`#`, `//`, or `;`)
- **Bad Character Identification**: Quickly identify and highlight problematic bytes in your shellcode.
- **No External Dependencies**: Utilizes only Binary Ninja's built-in functionalities, ensuring a lightweight and easily deployable solution.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Copy the plugin file to your Binary Ninja plugins folder:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Binary Ninja\plugins\`
   - Linux: `~/.binaryninja/plugins/`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Binary Ninja/plugins/`
3. Restart Binary Ninja or reload plugins.

## Usage

1. Open Binary Ninja and navigate to the "Plugins" menu.
2. Select "Shellcoder" to open the plugin interface.
3. Enter your assembly code or hex-formatted shellcode in the input area.
4. Choose your desired output format and options.
5. Click "Assemble" to process your input.
6. View the results in the output area.

_Note_: Alternatively you can use `CTRL+p` to open the command palette and search for the plugin.
