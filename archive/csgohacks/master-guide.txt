# Aimware

Aimware is one of the if not the most known cheat for CSGO, its been around for years and has always been a solid choice for both legit and hvh. It offers fairly cheap lifetime for ~100$ which can be brought way down to 60$ if there is a discount code and sale active.


```

`cheat-configuration/aimware/blatant.md`:

```md
# Blatant

Semi raging is when a person goes as blatantly as possible while trying to hide from overwatch. In most cases players end up using a trigger bot on a fairly low delay and high FOV with low smoothing on their legit bot. Although some players choose to use the ragebot on key \(Mouse 1\) with a low FOV, this style of semi raging is mostly used when playing against other semi ragers in a "legit" HvH game.

The basics to semi rage with aimware are the following:

Always use legit AA. When using a legit bot to semi rage, use high FOV with low smoothing and a fairly low delay trigger bot. When using a rage bot to semi rage, use low FOV and set the rage bot to shoot on key.

## Making a config


```

`cheat-configuration/aimware/closet.md`:

```md
# Closet

Closet cheating is the most legit looking method of cheating. In most cases closet cheaters dont use ESP/Chams and resort to only using a low FOV legit bot, as this basicaly guarenttes you wont be caught by overwatch \(If you do it well\).

The basics to closet cheating with aimware are the following:

Only use ESP/Chams if you are confident in you being able to resist the urge to look aim at people through walls. Never use low smoothing on your legit bot, and never use a trigger bot.

## Making a config


```

`cheat-configuration/aimware/hvh.md`:

```md
# HvH

HvH aka hack vs hack is a "gamemode" that has been around as long as cheats have existed. Here cheaters play against other cheaters usually on community servers with VAC disabled using the rage bot. This gamemode is basically a sandbox where cheaters go against each other to see who has the best cheat/config.

In HvH with most public/private cheats the cheat itself doesnt make that huge of a differnce to your preformance as long as you are using an decent cheat, the two most important factors are your playstyle and your config. This guide should help you understand the basics of configing and will explain how to adapt settings to your playstyle \(e.g agressive, defensive, semi agressive and pussy 1wer\)

## Making a config

The first step to making your hvh config is to determine your playstyle in hvh. Once you have determined that then you can move on to making your own config by following the steps/guide below:

First off, the "Aimbot" tab:

Most of the features here are self explanitory so ill only go over the ones that are important here.

FOV: The field of view of the rage bot aka where the rbot will aim. Always set this to 180 degrees since ur hvhing.

Aim Lock: This forces the rbot to aim at one target until it is killed. Dont recommend having this on since in some senarios its better to take shots at multiple enemies and not just focus on one.

Knife bot: Automatically stabs with your knife depending on the mode selected. Since aimware fixed the default knifebot i recomemnd using that one.

Now onto the "Accuracy" tab:

Here the features dont need explination so I will just guide you on what to set values to.

Slowwalk: I dont recommend going over 34% on this, I usually go for something around 15-34%. Doublefire: Use rapid for agressive and sift for passive playstyle. Zeus:From my experience with aimware the best settings to use for the zeus are, 80 hit chance, 100 minimum damage.

Pistols: Depending on the agressiveness of your playstyle you would want to lower the hit chance to be able to shoot at higher speeds, Between 20-65% hit chance again depending on how agressively you play with pistols, Between 8-20 depending on the pistol you are using, lower for lower damage pistols,

Heavy Pistols: hitchance should regardles of your playstyle be atleast 40 and max 60, for mindmg you can use anything from 20 to 60 depending on how early you want to shoot.

Submachine Guns: any hitchance and mindmg from 5 to 15 will work.

Rifles:

Shotguns:

Scout: For hitchance 70 to 90 depending how early you want to shoot and how much you are ready to miss to shoot earlier. For mindmg use 70 to 100 \(over 93 will go for head mostly\)

Auto Snipers: For hitchance anything less than 60 will make you miss, and anything over 80 will make you shoot too late.

AWP: for hitchance choose something between 70 and 90 depending on how early you want to shoot. Mindmg should always be 100.

LMGs:

The "Hit Scan" tab: Aimware has quite unique way of doing hitscan, we will start with the mode and advanced tabs and then take a look at the hitbox points. Mode:[https://imgur.com/kG07T99](https://imgur.com/kG07T99)

For bodyaim you should use lethal on everything expect on auto and awp where its recommended to use priority, for hitbox overlap \(safepoint\) there are 3 options.

[https://imgur.com/U8SdqWP](https://imgur.com/U8SdqWP) \(use one option per weapon\)

zeus: Dont use safepoint.

Pistol: use prefer or advanced.

Heavy Pistol: use prefer or advanced.

Submachine Gun: use prefer or advanced.

Rifle: use prefer, advanced or no safepoint.

Shotgun: use prefer.

Scout: you should choose between no safepoint, advanced or prefer.

Auto Snipers: its recomemnded to either use prefer or force.

AWP: Use force safepoint.

LMGs: Dont use safepoint

[https://imgur.com/jlsowrw](https://imgur.com/jlsowrw)

For most users i recommend something between 40 and 75, lower for more agressive playstyle, for people with poor performance i recommend using the lowest option. ![](https://imgur.com/zZIboDs)

This is the part where aimware configin comes down to personal preference, high options \(red and orange\) might cause fps issues on low end computers.

Pistols: head green-orange body blue-green, dont use legs or hands.

Heavy Pistols: if you want to baim i recommend having head on blue-green and body on green-red, dont use legs or hands. If you want to go for head use green-red for head and blue-green for body.

Submachine guns: it doesnt really matter what you use, turn head green and everything else blue.

Rifle: Put head on green-red depending on your personal preference. For body use green-blue.

Shotguns:

Scout: This is where you have multiple options, remember to keep head on higher than body green-red, and body on blue-orange \(you can disable chest to make sure you dont shoot below mindmg\)

Auto: Head on blue. For body you can use different combos, anything from green to orange. For legs do nothing-green.

AWP: Head on blue, and stomach/pelvin on green-red.

LMGs:

The "Anti Aim" tab:Use Down pitch, real yaw backwards, Fake yaw default or opposite, at targets and autodirection if you dont want to use manual antiaim. Fakeduck allows you to shoot higher while crouching.

Static legs: Not helpfull, sometimes breaks aa.

Conditions: use disable on use \(e\) to get some 1ws you cant use without it, disable on grenade if you grenades go to the floor instead of where you throw them.

Shift On Shot: use on scout to prevent being onshotted, on other guns its useless and makes dt slow.

Fake expose: not usefull

Manual antiaim: personal preference.

Anti-Resolver: Presonal preference, makes some resolvers miss more.

Advanced configuration: Allows acces to yaw angle and lby extender, if you know what you are doing go ahead.

# Legit

Legit cheating is in the simplest terms is cheating in a way to get a big advantage over your legit enemies while staying lowkey enough to be very safe from overwatch. Most legit cheaters usually end up using a mix of a high delay triggerbot and low fov, medium smoothing legit bot.

# Introduction

Nowdays there are a lot of functions in cheats for CSGO, and it will take time to set up the cheat from sratch everytime. Therefore configuration files \(configs\) are born. They are designed to reduce the time setting up configuration, while just loading up as a single file.

In the section, you will going to learn about:

* Setting up different configurations for various playstyle \(legit, rage, semirage...\), and explaining the concepts on configs.
* Know more about paid configs

## Concepts

### Legit/Closet cheating

The critical thing for legit cheating is trying to convince from your teammates, enemy and overwatchers that your are a legit player. Thus obviously you won't see rage features activated \(i.e 180 aimbot, yaw anti-aim etc.\). Instead, we will focused on making our aimbots more "humanized", whihc makes the cheat to slowly drag the crosshair to the target player's desired body position.

Also in most situation, we would like to let the aimbot to aim for the body first, whihc makes it look convincing. As for players who had a hard time to controlling recoil, the RCS would also be their interested feature to setup.

Finally for movements and miscallaneous, this is down to personal's perference. To start with, all "zhun wanna-bes" must priortize on making their strafing features looks like a professional bhop player. Plus, gernade spot helper would also be useful for you to throw some insane gernades.

### Semirage

In fact, the defination of the term "semirage" actually varies in different player. However at here, we would define "semirage" as "Disable yaw anti-aim in rage anti-aim mode, use rage aimbot without getting triggered by VACnet". In fact, it makes semirage as "rage mode without yaw anti-aim". In this mode, you focus would be in anti-aims and rage aimbot.

For rage aimbot, it is recommend that the target fov would be no higher that 30 degrees fov. And features like dymanic fov is also recommend to be enable when semiraging, which is useful when targeting enemy from different distances. The autowall inside rage aimbot is also our focus, too. Usually, autowalls should be set to "legit" \(Shooting through walls that legit players could also do\). This is usually achieved by scripts.

Regarding weapon targeting, usually the minium damage of different will be set to each weapon's default minium damage to the torso, which could be find at [here](https://csgo-stats.com/weapons).

You are being warned that setting the minium damage too low would makes the aimbot to shoot too early, which makes you cannot damage the emeny player effectivly, and you will getting in "on-shot" state. The "on-shot" state will makes other cheat to be able to caught the position of your playermodel's head as when your player is shooting, there is no anti-aim enabled. While vice versa will makes your cheat seldom will shoot as it is hard to match the high minium damage confition. In all here's the general concept for most of the weapons you would used in hvh:

* AWP: Usually the minium would be set to 85. This would allow most cheat to gave a lethal shot to the emeny player. However if the cheat misses too much on giving the lethal shot, it is recommended to make the minium damage to HP+1 \(101 damage\) ~ HP+3 \(103 damage\).
* AUTOs: It depends on which gamemode and your playstyle \(matchmaking/community hvh server?, semirage/rage?\) In general, setting the minium damage to 50~55 would be an ideal value, as it could be applied in both matchmaking and community hvh.
* Scout: The general idea of scout is set it's minium damage to around 75 or above, however in matchmaking, if there is only one cheater, you can take the risk by setting the minium damage to HP+1 \(101 damage\), to catch the emeny's "on-shot" state for the most lethal shot. However this would let you having the chance to take some damage. So please use it wisely.
* Pistols: It depends on which pistol you're using. For deage/revlovers, the damage would usually set to as close to scout's general minium damage \(75 damage\). While for dual brettas, it is recommend to set the minium damage to 25 damage.

Despite the discourage of setting the minium damage too low, it is still recommend that having features like minium-damage oevrride standby, with minium damage would be set to a very low value \(5~25 damage\). This is useful when you're holding spots that only few damages could be made, thus it could slowly hurting the enemy player to death.

### Hitchance

Hitchances are the chances of one shot hitting the enemy plyer when firing bullets. The general idea for one-shot weapons to set their hitchance 75% or above, and auto weapons would be slight lower to around 65%.

### Rage

Rage cheating would share the same roots with semirage, while making improvements on anti-aim. // TODO

`cheat-configuration/introduction/paid-configurations.md`:

```md
# Paid configurations

You may see lot's of famous youtubers are dominating in every hvh match, while you only barely killing a player. Then theese youtubers told you to join their membership to get access to their configs. You instantly join their membership, download their config, try it out... And nothing changed. You're still gettting killed by other players, with yourself still wondering "How am I still doing badly, even though I am using their config?"

## Configs don't represent the whole picture

A good config can help you to get more kills, but the most important thing is your playstyle. You need both to to dominate a match. Also, there is the sad truth that you may not be using the same config as the youtubers are using themselves, which means they might be selling a fake config. Even if they are selling the same config as they show in their videos, you still have the chance that it might not suit your playstyle, because its made for their own playstyle and not yours.

## Scripts

As more cheats developers supports scripting to extend the behaviour of their product, there are a lot of scripts that is paid, while some don't. There is no denying there are some scripts that actually could ehance the experience when using the cheat, like semirage scripts \(which is missing in some cheats\), griefing scripts \(fake votes, blockbot\) or movement scripts. However there are a lot of useless scripts on the market that are paid or free to take. These scripts will simply wasting your time on using it. In short, it is recommend to avoid scripts like:

* Anti-aim scripts: This is a little bit conterversal as some scripts would actually useful, however in fact most of them are useless as desync anti-aims are very limited. Also for newcomers, you will be disappointed that using a anti-aim scripts won't make you become a god instantly, as it is also tied to playstyle. In short, if you don't know how you can set-up these anti-aim scripts, don't buy it.
* "HvH essentials" scripts: A lot of people will stacking up different essential scripts to hope for a best performance. Which is kinda useless as they are being limited by the cheat they are running on. In short, when getting these scripts you should take a look at:
  * Minium damage override
  * Matchmaking fakeduck
  * //TODO

If your cheat is missing the features above, then you should take at least one of these scripts.

* Reslover scripts: Straightforward blatant scam. There is no way to 100% reslove desync anti-aims. Also in the cheat itself, you can both force body-aim a player, or trying to reslover override. \(That said there is still no gurantee you will able to kill the enemy player.\)

## Leaked Configs

It's inevitable that youtubers configs get leaked and if you know where to look you can find almost any youtubers config you want. A good place to start is by looking at leaking websites and the cheat forums themselves, there are a ton of good congifs for free on the forums. Some may be over hyped in the title, like they always are, but doesnt hurt to try them.

Here are some examples of config-leaking websites:

* [Matt1's leaked configuration collection](https://old.reddit.com/r/Csgohacks/comments/f1wdlb/freak_config_pack_reuploaded/)
* [Teeesense.xyz](https://teeesense.xyz/forums/)
* [Streetwits.xyz](https://streetwits.xyz/forums/)
* hentaiware.moe
* [sleek.rip](https://sleek.rip/home.php)
* [horrid.pw](https://horrid.pw/)
* [clowned.cc](https://forum.clowned.cc/)
* failure.website
* [spamtec.cc](http://spamtec.cc/)

Some of the aformentioned websites are invite only sadly, but in the end almost all the websites have the same leaked configs.

## Config Packs

Some youtubers \(Freak\) have made massive cfg packs with hundreds of cfgs to try some paid, some public.

Here is a link to a post on the subreddit with links to download it:

# HvH

**Configurating the cheat**

First off you're gonna have to select the weapon / weapons of your choice when HvH-ing \(SSG-08, SCAR-20, G3SG1, AWP, R8, Deagle, etc\). These weapons are the most common in HvH because of accuracy, damage, and oneshot potiential. So now you have a weapon in mind what settings do you need?

## Features

First before you start trying to config your cheat you should know what features your cheat has and what they do. We will start with the general tab under rage.

### General

The first thing you're gonna see is _enabled_ this is the button that will activate the ragebot. If you right click it you will see options such as _none_, _toggle_, _hold_, and _always_. If you're HvH-ing your gonna want this to be always on.

* Pitch resolver This feature is mainly used for nospread HvH for when other pitches might be present.
* Silent This is for local view only, but it will not snap to targets on your screen. Spectators and overtwatchers will still see you snapping.
* Team check This will make the aimbot check to see if there is a teammate that might get shot when shooting an enemy.
* Auto scope This will automatically scope for you letting you know your aimbot has / had a shot on an enemy.
* Resolver override It will override your resolver turning it off so you can manually shoot someone if you know where their real is.
* Force body aim Will force the aimbot to only shoot body.
* Force safepoint Will force the cheat to shoot safepoints only. \(_Safepoints where the real and fake meet. So it pretty much guarantees a hit_\)

### Exploits

* Hideshots This is an exploit that prevents you from getting onshotted, by tickbase manipulation.
* Doubletap Another exploit that uses tickbase manipulation. It will fire two shots in a time it would normally take one shot

### Targeting

* Fov The field of view of the rage bot.
* Minimum damage The minimum damage for the ragebot to shoot a target. If minimum damage is set to 50 the ragebot will not shoot unless the player can atleast be hit for 50 damage.
* Hitboxes The hitboxes the ragebot will aim for on the player.
* Multipoint hitboxes Multiplepoint hitbox adds a certain amount of points on the edges of hitboxes to hit edgers / boxers easier.

### Accuracy

* Hitchance This is the % the ragebot will shoot your minimum damage at. Say you have 100% hitchance with 1 minimum damage, the ragebot will not shoot unless it has a 100% chance of hittting the enemy for 1 damage.
* Autostop Automatically reduces speed to obtain higher accuracy when someone is being targeted.
* Prefer safepoint Make the ragebot prefer safepoint conditions.
* Prefer body aim Make the ragebot prefer body aim conditions

## Making a config

### \(_HC = Hitchance, MP = Multipoint, Baim = Body Aim_\)

This will vary to each person because of your playstyle.

### Pistols

The most used pistols in HvH are the heavy pistols and the dual berettas.

**R8 and Deagle** HC: 40% - 60% Min Dmg: 20 - 40 Hitboxes: Head, Upper chest, Chest, Lower chest, Stomach, and Pelvis Multipoint: Head, Chest, Stomach, and Pelvis Change these values accordingly to suite your playstyle

**Dual berettas** HC: 30% - 50% Min Dmg: 15 - 30 Hitboxes: All Multipoint : All

### Snipers

**Auto Snipers** This will vary depending if you want to try to hit head or baim people. HC: 60%-80% Min Dmg:20-30 _I would set up an override key to drop your min dmg down to 1 when necessary_ Hitboxes: All Multipoint : All

**Scout** HC: 60% - 80% Min Dmg: 65 - 93 Hitboxes: Head, Upper chest, Chest Multipoint: Head, Upper chest, Chest,

**Awp** HC: 70% - 85% Min Dmg: 101 Hitboxes: Head, Upper chest, Chest, Lower chest, Stomach, and Pelvis Multipoint: Head, Upper chest, Chest, Lower chest, Stomach, and Pelvis Prefer safepoint and Prefer body aim

## Anti Aim

### Rage Anti Aim

* At targets Automatically applies the safest orientation based upon player position
* Auto direction Automatically changes your position based on eye view.
* Mouse direction Changesanti-aim based off of the mouse location when using hotkey.
* Manual direction Enables manual direction override.

### Fake Angles

* Air mode Changes the mode depending on if your airbourne or not.
* LBY mode \(Lowerbody Yaw\) Type of fake angles for LBY.
* Desync on shot Desyncs animations sent to the server on shot.
* Hide real angle \(Freestanding\) Will run freestanding to hide real.
* Avoid overlap Avoid overlapping real and fake angles.
* Fake desync Standing anti-aim.
* Inverter \(key\) Flips the fake angle to the opposite direction.
* Inverter flip Conditions for inverter.

### Extra

* Fake duck Allows you to remain in the crouched state while maintaining the normal standing targeting ability.
* Slow walk Speed reduction to maintain accuracy and reduce the chance of being hit

## Anti Aim Configuration

_Enabled_ At targets \(_preference_\) Yaw Offset - 0 Jitter Offset - 0 or between -8 and 8

### Fake Angles

_Enabled_ Air mode - Normal LBY Mode - Opposite Fake Desync Hide real angle

Fake duck - on key Slow walk - hold

# Anti-Cheats

## General

Here we will introduce some common anti-cheats for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive \(CSGO\). There are the most common anti-cheat: VAC \(Valve Anti-Cheat\) and other league cheats. In general, league cheats are more harder to bypass and way more expensive while cheats that are aimed to bypass VAC are way more cheaper, while the bypass methods are more easier.

## VAC \(Valve Anti-Cheat\)

Valve Anti-Cheat is the default anti-cheat software used in CSGO. \(TODO: remove all the content after this setence in VAC section,don't trust anything in VAC introduction!\) Which uses signature detection to detect whether a program is modifiying the memory address for CSGO. Most cheating software introduced here are aimed to bypass VAC with different methods.

## VAC vs VACNET

A lot of people get confused about VAC and VACNET, thinking they are the same stuff, which in fact isn't.

VAC is an anti cheat. It detects cheats on your computer. It's generally not very secure.

VACNET is an "AI" system that can detect cheaters. It is generally only effective against spin botters. It recently had an update that stated there will be less spin botters in overwatch. Whether this means they will insta ban afterwards or it requires less confirmations, no one is sure.

## ESEA Anti-Cheat

ESEA Anti Cheat is a client sided Anti Cheat that is pretty strong, meaning there are not that many cheats out for it and they are like cheats for Faceit client side really expensive. \(More info needed\)

## FACEIT server side

Faceit server side is less secure than client side. It detects anti aim, certain types of aimbot, and rage bot, and other manipulations like backtrack. However, many p2c's do indeed support server side; for example, skeet. Ratpoison is a free cheat that does as well.

## FACEIT client side

Faceit client side is incredibly hard and expensive to bypass correctly. Expect to spend several hundred monthly \(and still no guarantee of 100% undetectedness\) because this anti cheat is well written. Also, if they ban you for cheating on client side, they WILL analyze your computer and the info will be send back. Faceit is very intrusive by design and as such if a single player gets banned on client side, even if it's a manual overwatch-type ban, the cheat could be analyzed and everyone could get hit.

## SMAC \(SourceMod Anti-Cheat\)

SMAC is a plugin server owners can use to protect their servers more. It is used on community servers. Due to it, being server sided it can't detect that much. Aimbot above a certain FOV for example will get detected. Many cheats also bypass SMAC, they just restrict your FOV and some other features, the same way it is done in Aimstep. \(I think it can detect more than just Aimbot above I think it was 40+ FOV but dunno --TODO\)

```md
# Common mistakes when choosing a cheat software

When you choosing your first cheat in CSGO, you may feel confused with so many cheat providers out there, and don't know which cheat provider you should choose first. This page aims to help you to choose about your first cheat.

## Internal vs External

Internal means the whole cheat is injected into the csgo process. No other window for the menu. Internals are more efficient, achieving more cheat features such as anti-aim \(Spinbot\). It has a active community on github, unknowncheats, and mpgh to research on internal cheats. However, the main programming language, C++ is difficult to learn from zero coding experience.\(at least personally! -2772\)

Externals are usually separate windows and can be slower. Almost always used only for legit cheats. It is limted to achive blatant features with it, and rage features are definitely impossible. Compared to internals, cheat developers can use more techniques against detection \(low ring for example\), easy to write for basic features compared to c++ \(again, personally -2772\). However externals are much less efficient because they can only modify CSGO's gameprocess by using win32 functions `OpenProcess()`,`ReadProcessMemory()` and `WriteProcessMemory()`, which can be laggy if not optimized properly.

Most common cheat providers are offering an internal cheat, due to their much better efficiency and constant accurate timing, which is crtical for HvH, meanwhile external is very delayed compared to internals.

What ISN'T different between the 2: detection is not easier or harder on internal or external. They are about the individual cheat.

## Where should I obtain the sources?

A lot of people have learnt about cheating mostly from influencers, cheater themselves. However please notice that the cheat they are recommending only fits their case, might not suitable to yours. Specially on youtube. Some youtube influencers will make fake reviews if they got sponsored within a amount of money. So if you're going to find reviews about different cheat, you should watch those who would also discuss about the downsides of the cheat they're reviewing. Again, that the cheat they are reviewing may only fits their case, might not suit to yours. Tho watching those reviews could help you find a cheat to start around.

## What shall I consider when choosing my first cheat?

This digram helps you to choose your first cheat by asking yourself various questions:

* Am I going to pay for a cheat?
* If I am going to pay for a cheat, how much would I spend on it?
* What kind of features do I want most? Legit cheating features, or with rage \(spinbot\) features too?
* If I dont want to pay for a cheat, do I have programming experience to fix the public sources available?...

![Diagram when choosing an CSGO cheat. \(Shoutout to matt/throwaway who made this digram, a detailed version could be found here: https://www.zenflowchart.com/docs/view/kpPy7LDdw25Xb1YKXAxl\)](https://i.imgur.com/st4IqSi.png)

After you go through this diagram, you should have a clear mind of which cheat you should have.

## Is x and y cheat good? Anyone heard about it?

We cannot cover all the cheat providers available in the market, maybe there is a new cheat available right as you reading this guide. However you as a newcomer, we still highly recommend to use some well-known cheat providers as your first cheat, since they have proven to be legit, and have got a large amount of different reviews.

Even tho, if you really would like to hear about other less-known cheat providers, feel free to ask on [our subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Csgohacks/)

# Linux and macOS cheats

Despite most of the cheat providers only providing their cheat software for Windows, there are still some open-source solutions for Linux and macOS players. However keep in mind that these cheats would require the user, which is you, to compile the cheat on your own. So it is recommend that you should have some experiences in reading before doing so.

Also you should have noticed that these open-source solutions usually doesn't come with a good resolver and a rage aimbot with features required for competitive rage cheating, so just try to avoid rage cheating on macOS and Linux.

## Linux

Valve's VAC team do not actively work on detecting cheats on macOS or Linux. Therefore, there are many cheats still undetected after years of inactive development.

[gamesneeze](https://github.com/seksea/gamesneeze) \(not to be confused with gamesense, which only available on Windows\) is a Linux cheat with legit and rage features available. It is still in active development and will happily take pull requests for improvements.

### Fuzion

[Fuzion](https://github.com/LWSS/Fuzion) is a Linux cheat that is modified from AimTux, another CS:GO cheat that was no longer maintained. It has legit and rage features available. However as mentioned from GitHub, some users have reported that the cheat might be detected, so it is recommend to use other active public forks, like [MissedIT](https://github.com/HackerPolice/MissedIT).

### Osiris

[Osiris](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/Osiris) is also available for linux.  (more info available at the “free-and-pastes” section)

## macOS

Due to macOS's security features, it is difficult for cheat developers to code a cheat on macOS, however this also applies to VAC, which it's functionality is limited due to the same reason.

[ButOSX](https://github.com/Lyceion/ButOSX) is technically not a "Cheat software", but instead is a software base that could allow other cheat developers to work on it. It is the only public project that is in active development and supports injecting on M1 chips. If you are interested in using macOS for CS:GO cheating, you should follow this project.

# Pastes and scams

These are some cheats that have been identified as scams, which you should just stay away from them.

## Ezfrags

Ezfrags is technically not a paste, but with it's high detection it is not recommended to use.

Plus please do not buy Ezfrag's premium subscription, since it is just the same as Ezfrag's free version, but ironically it has a highly detection rate than the free version. So just stay away from both Ezfrag's plan.

## SmurfWrecker

SmurfWrecker is pasted heavily and is very detected, so you should stay away from it.

Both the Pro and Basic plans are terrible, and the 'legit' you can do with it is terrible, so please do not use it!

## Static-Ware

Static-Ware is literally just renamed SmurfWrecker, they didn't even change the watermark so please don't use it.

## VeteranCheats

Just a shameless cash grab that is probably pasted, has little features and is most likely detected so DO NOT USE.

## SkyCheats

Another shameless cash grab with little features, most likely renamed VeteranCheats so please stay away from it.

## time2win

Renamed VeteranCheats, as usual just a cash grab made by some kids so DO NOT BUY ANY SUBSCRIBTIONS FROM THEM.

## Battlelog

VeteranCheats, this is getting kind of annoying...

## Daxhack

Promoted by shady people, obviously a paste of osiris. Dev puts no effort into the project at all. Filled with alot of broken features

## Project Infinity

Project Infinity also has a free version, but since it has been identified as a paste and having a terrible detection rate, we do not recommend you to try it out, despite for some reason a lot of youtubers have chosen it to demostrate how CSGO cheating looks like.

## DarkAim

A jme paste, same dev that works on Abyss, InsanityCheats and used to work on Redeye Cheats, dev has sold pastes before, vac detected and receives nearly zero updates.

## InsanityCheats

A jme paste, same dev that works on Abyss, Darkaim and used to work on Redeye Cheats, dev has sold pastes before, sometimes vac detected and receives some updates. The staff team is alot better with this one out of the jme pastes.

## IWantCheats

Lying about permanent detections in multiple games.

## Singularity.wtf

Fake-Reviews, Fake-Infos

Little features for the price, dev couldn't give two flying ducks about the cheat \(thats why its pasted\), detected often and make sure to stay away from the free cheat as its so broken and nearly as detected as ezfrags.

## Omniaim

Bought their loader off of someone, Staff don't care about the cheat at all, Rarely receives updates and it's detected quite often.

## 5dollarcheats

Fake-Reviews, Vac detected very often and the dev doesn't care about the project.

## Redeye Cheats

Used to be a jme paste, Used to have the dev that worked on Darkaim, InsanityCheats and Abyss, Previous dev has sold pastes before, Now has a new dev but its still paste, not a very good detection record and they've tried to redeem themselves but its still pasted with a few of its features being broken.

## abyss.gg

A jme paste, same dev that works on Darkaim, InsanityCheats used to work on RedeyeCheats, Dev has sold pastes before, Vac detection issues, Receives nearly zero updates and a non-existent staff team/a team that doesn't care.

## ayyware

Basically an outdated open-source cheat.

## Zapped

## Controversial Section!

* This section describes a highly controversial event/item that may subject to change, you should NOT take this as an absolute reference. By reading the following section, you are agreeing that r/csgohacks and CSGO cheating masterguide contributors will not bear any reponsibility for any misleading information.

Zapped.cc is a highly controversial cheat provider that has been claimed to leaking it's user's ip address, causing user's online privacy might be compromised. Also according to [Boring](pastes-and-scams.md), a famous cheating youtuber, who has pointed out several evidence about zapped that it is a scam. However since we cannot validate the accuracy of his sources, we are still unable to give a conclusion as of right now, but until then it will still be on the paste and scam list.

## TODO Section

The cheats listed here should be avoid too. However we need more information why we should avoid them.

The definition of crosshair placement is when the player positions his/her crosshair to headshot level while peaking. It is crucial when trying to closet, since players can determine whether you are hacking or not. It takes a bit of time to memorise the placements in each corner and in each map, but after a few days of playing clean you will get the hang of it.

![A pretty common crosshair placement when peaking A Site in Dust 2, which is corsshair is always at the screen&apos;s middle, which is whre other player&apos;s head located](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/769491189050255925/985DC84FE63DC7135B840592B9E64430B8ED6971/)

A tip when peaking an angle is to jiggle peak/shoulder peak. This type of peaking gives you info about the whereabouts of the player without exposing yourself to them. Also, when there is an AWPer scoped in and holding an angle, you can shoulder peak to trigger their shot, and when they do, peak properly and attack them while they are waiting for the AWP bullet to reload or switch to another pistol.

Not to mention, do not look at the ground and put your corsshair to other players when you saw one. This is a free giveway to overwatchers.

## Movement

Movement is important is general, but even more when closet cheating.

Movement consists of two parts: Strafing, and bhopping \(bunny hopping\)

Strafing is the act of pressing the left/right keys on your keyboard \(usually A and D\) and moving your mouse in order to gain spead while mid air. The best way I would suggest improving your strafing skills is to hop in surfing servers and learn how to surf.

Bhopping is when the player jumps, and right before landing jumps again consistently without hitting the ground. Bhopping is usually used in order to gain speed, but in order to do so, the player must combine strafing and bhopping so that his or her speed will be consistent and fast. [Nadeking has a good tutorial on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwt2j8toi4s) There are a lot of community servers that are hosting bhop maps, which you can take some time to improve your bhop skills, or even make a name on it. However, the best way is to practice on offical servers since most bhop servers are running at 128 tickrate while offical servers are only at 64 tick, which makes bhopping more harder.

If you want to learn improve your movement skills, you can find some community servers that is running kz maps.

## RCS and Recoil Control

When closeting, I highly advice you to not use RCS as it is very obvious to other players or overwatchers. There are many workshop maps that help you learn recoil patterns, such as [Mr. uLLeticaL™-S- map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847) or [Yprac's map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1365781615). Also, cetrain cheat providers have a "recoil crosshair". However, if you really cannot do without rcs I suggest to go with: _50.0 on X axis_ 60.0 on Y axis.

## Visuals

For visuals, it is up to personal favourite. However I suggest newcomers do not use any visual assistance \(ESP thorugh walls\), since you will automitaclly aim to them through walls, which will look extremely obvious. I suggest using Visable charms is already enough. Once you've build up experience without visual assistance, you can try turn on ESP. This might sounds ruin the purpose of cheating, but this is what it takes to make yourself look like a good player. It is this or that.

## Map knowledge

Map knowledge helps you to become a good player, without doubt. Without map knowledge, you have no idea what should you do in different situations. If you want to learn about maps, [here](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413) is a good collection of maps that you should take some time learn about the nade spots \(even you have gernade helper\), prefire spots, etc.

## Conclusion

If you want to be the next zhun/woke/whoever 'professional' high performance CS player, you should at least take some time to learn about maps, gun spraying, movement, remember, cheats are only "assists" your skills in legit cheating scene.

# Closet? Legit?

A lot of newcomers get confused about the difference between a closet cheater and a legit cheater. A closet cheater plays with overy little features on \(see below\). These cheaters are very hard to detect due to the use of very subtle settings in a game compared to legit cheaters. A legit cheater is a bit easier to detect ingame due to certain factors. They are usually given away by their backtracking or the shots they are hitting. They tend to use a much bigger variety of features compared to closet cheaters \(see below\).

## Closet Cheating

* Nade Helper
* No ESP
* Miniture aimbot assist
* No RCS-Little RCS
* A low value of triggerbot + backtracking \(even none\)

## Legit cheating

* Low-Medium aimbot assist
* RCS
* A high value of triggerbot + backtracking
* Movement settings such as: Bhops, Auto-Strafe \(Less common ones are\): Edgebug, Edgejump and a Movement recorder
* ESP
* Nade Helper

# Legit Cheating

## Legit Cheating

Legit cheating means that you look like a player that is not cheating.

## Some features you should use:

* Radar hack: Radar hack lets you see enemies on your radar. It is better than regular ESP because it allows you to expect players, but not exactly where they are.
* Sound ESP: Sound ESP is much better for legit play than regular ESP, because you only see it if the player is making noise. This means you know a player is there, however don't peek directly onto their head because the sound isn't that precise and it can be blatant.
* Grenade helper: Grenade helper helps you throw grenades by showing you the exact path they will travel. Some cheats have this feature built in \(Novolinehook-require user set up, spirthack\), while others requires a lua to achieve this. \(Aimware, onetap, etc\)

## Lose rounds!

Voluntarily die against bad players! In rounds where you're up by a handful, lose. In 14-14 rounds, it's okay to go a little harder. Lose unimportant rounds.

## Practice movement!

This is why people call you out most of the time. Silver movement, Global aim. Just hack barely enough to win at your rank. No more.

## High-rank matches

TODO

## Don't rage!

If there is someone actually cheating, don't care about them. Even you've toggled your blatant config, your trust factor still go low and you will face even more ragers at the end, it just dosen't worth the price of winning one round and facing more cheaters.

# Legit HvH

## Legit HvH

Legit HvH, or commonly known as semi-raging, is when two players toggle on their cheats to their full potential, while still trying to avoid an Overwatch ban. This usually consists of the players having legit anti-aim instead of full on rage anti-aim.

## Playstyle

--todo--

Semiragers have to make sure to make good use of grenades, e.g. They prefer to use HE grenades the most to lower their opponents hp then Molotov's and smoke grenades come next to block a push or to allow a push to continue by smoking off a molotov.

# Tips for legits

## Tips for closet legit players

Some features you should use:

## When using Esp/Glow dont make it obvious

One of the most suspicious thinge in the world is when an agressive player suddenly stops infront of a door, and _somehow_ an enmy walks through. It will almost always get you overwatched. sometimes its okay to run through a door and get shot. it should be obvious, but this is one of the things that overwatch ban the most

## Other small tidbits to keep in mind

-Keep triggerbot and other blatant cheats to a minimum or simply dont use them

-If a cheat that you are using aldready has a legit config, look into it, see its keybinds, and pre-enabled modules that you may not need. dont just use a config blindly

-Ask people you know if you look legit. if they say you dont, its time to change settings

-If you know someone is cheating on the other team, dont engage in legit HvH, at least try not to. try and bitch loud enough that they get overwatched

-If someone is cheating on your team. make sure you have lower settings than them, so people only suspect the other player

# Luckycharms

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JWK1bMH3JQU/hqdefault.jpg)

Luckycharms is a free cheat developed by a youtube user called [lucky](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh-TyD-_lUzknDDHoicsgTQ). According to lucky, this is a HvH-focused cheat which aims for users who don't want to use Onetap crack and cannot afford for a paid cheat.

## Pricetag

* Free for only HvH features
* 25 HKD - 200 HKD \(~3 USD - 25 USD, depending on the membership plan\) for 'Early Access'

## Testimonials

### Opinions ahead!

--TODO: DO NOT TAKE THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS AS REFERENCE!

* The following section is only from the users who used luckycharms as their major cheating software, however theese only should taken as references only.
* All theese testimonials does not represnt the offical statment of the r/csgohacks subreddit.

### Legitbot

* Only available for Early-access role users, which is not focused in our cover

### Ragebot

* Anti-Aim is wacky, however a recent update brings a god-like anti-aim method to aimware. --TODO
* Reslover is extremely un-optimized, causing FPS drop often.

### Visuals

-- TODO: Insert ESP demo

* Information-rich ESP \(Hostages, C4, dropped weapons, etc\)
* Highly customizable option, which means will take time to configure
* Charms are not very favourable by most users.

### Services

### Overall

* No legitbot in free version
* A men ragebot
* Meh Visuals
* Feature-rich miscellaneous options
* Bad customer services

# Pastes

A paste is, when you take a public source or the code from somebody else and use it in your cheat. It is a good way if you don't want to pay for a cheat. However since most of these cheats are only available in source code, we have to compile it before we can inject it to the game.

In this section, we will go through about:

* How to set up a development environment for pasting
* How to paste common public sources
  * Oriris
  * Sensum
  * Ratpoision
  * Xy0

```

`free-and-pastes/pastes/how-to-set-up-the-development-environment.md`:

# How to set up the development environment

Before pasting a cheat, you have to install a development environment: Visual Studio

## How to install Visual Studio

Before you install Visual Studio, you have to make sure you've meet Visual Studio's system recommend requirements:

* Windows 7 x64 or above
* A processor comes up after 2012
* 4 GB RAM
* 20 GB hard disk space or above

After that, head over to [Visual Studio's website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): Then Click on Community 2019 under Download Visual Studio. ![vsdownload](https://prnt.sc/t3uuma)

After the download is done, start the installer, and if you receive a User Account Control notice, choose Yes. \[TODO: Photos\]

Then you should head up with visual studio's installer, that will let you choose which components you should install. Select using C++ for desktop development and C++ for game development. \[TODO: Photos\]

Then wait for it to install, which can take up to several hours. \[TODO: Photos\]

When it is done. Launch Visual Studio and post install instructions. \[TODO: Photos\]

# Osiris

Osiris is an open-source legit cheat for CS:GO. It is commonly used as a base for pasted cheats. In this guide by BaconatorPizza, is going to teach how to compile osiris from source.

***

## Step 1: Downloading Needed Items

Download the [Osiris source](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/Osiris). Osiris is one of the most stable open source cheats with the most features.

Download [SigBench](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/anti-cheat-bypass/167449-sigbench-test-binary-signature-scans.html), we will use it to compare signatures.

Download any source code obfuscator that works decently well for C++.

Lastly, download [the VMProtect demo](https://vmpsoft.com/purchase/buy-online/).

***

## Step 2: Setting Up

Extract the .ZIP file you downloaded with the Osiris source inside of it. Double click the .sln file inside of the folder you extract. This will open Visual Studio.

![Failed to load image](https://preview.redd.it/1ec9jyqmthi51.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f354cdbff8ddc923a9bea990ad43305fa0feeb4)

Right click the text that says 'Osiris' on the sidebar, and click Properties. Click on the arrow next to C/C++, click on Optimization, and set Optimization to 'Disabled (/Od)'.

Click OK.

![Failed to load image](https://preview.redd.it/7uc4dzumr8y31.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=a98d79a9cdd273c142cfe4c6101f10ab63119835)

Then, in the top bar, change Debug to Release, and change the thing next to it to x86 (it should be x86 by default though).

![Failed to load image](https://preview.redd.it/pyn1lr6yuhi51.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=627d3c4b81f3390e18a3457039f18872eec24e93)

Press Local Windows Debugger (or whatever it says for you), and wait for it to build. Then go into your project folder again, and then into Release, you should see a file called Osiris.dll. Copy that file and paste it in another directory for later, like your Desktop.

***

## Step 3: Removing VMT Hooking

On the sidebar, you will see a folder called Hooks, open that up and delete VmtSwap.cpp, VmtSwap.h, VmtHook.cpp and VmtHook.h.

Next go into Header Files, and open Hooks.h. You will see 2 lines towards the top:

```cpp
#include "Hooks/VmtHook.h"

#include "Hooks.VmtSwap.h"
```

Delete these 2 lines.

You will also see a line saying using `using HookType = VmtSwap;`, delete that line too.

You are done removing VMT hooking! Onto the next step.

***

## Step 4: Removing Features

Go into the folder called hacks, and delete all the files for features you will not use. Delete the .cpp and .h files. If you aren't too much of a skid, you can go into Visuals.cpp and delete the functions for visuals you will not use.

Next go into Source Files, and open up Config.cpp. You should have a ton of errors. Simply delete the lines that are causing the errors. (ex. If you have an error on line 15, delete line 15).

Go into Hooks.cpp, and do the same. Lastly, do the same for GUI.cpp.

Press Local Windows Debugger again, because sometimes (or at least for me), certain errors don't show up until you compile. Also, if it says the error is in GUI.obj, Hooks.obj or etc, open up file-with-error.cpp. If it does not show the error in there, open up file-with-error.h.

You are done removing features! Onto the next step.

***

## Step 5: Renaming Features

Of course, every file/feature has a name. VAC however, can scan your cheats code and check for those names (and just other aspects of the code). If it matches known cheat code (which it will, Osiris and other open source cheats are most definitely detected), it will ban you.

So what we must do, is rename things to combat this. This won't totally solve our problem, but it still helps a bit. On top of that, it will change up the signature a little bit, which is nice!

For example, rename Backtrack.cpp and Backtrack.h to AimRewind (or something like that). Keep in mind you must also change this in all references to the file, like when another file is doing `#include <Hacks/Backtrack.cpp>`.

In places like GUI.cpp, the string containing what it will actually display as the name doesn't need to have it's value modified. However, it's a smart idea to rename the variable itself.

Once you have done this for most things in the cheat, move onto the next step!

***

## Step 6: Modifying Code

You know of how I said VAC scans your cheat against known cheat code? Well renaming things on it's own isn't enough. We need to do more!

Even doing little things such as replacing `currentTargetXPos = 52.234` with `currentTargetXPos = 50 + 2.234` (or something like that lol, just an example I came up with) will not only change the signature, but combat VAC detection!

So go around doing this. It will probably take a while. However, if you do it enough, it will help a lot with making your paste undetected.

Once you have done this for most things in the cheat, move onto the next step!

***

## Step 7: Compiling

This last step will help you compile your cheat.

First of all, if you did decide to use a source code obfuscator, make sure you use that first before you compile because it probably wont work on your finished build of the cheat. Once you have ran it, press Local Windows Debugger to compile.

Next, go into your project folder, Release, and rename the DLL inside to whatever you want your cheat to be called (ex. RainbowWare).

If you decided to get VMProtect, run that on your DLL. Take the outputted one, and now we will test the signatures!

Open up SigBench. In the first slot, input the original DLL from earlier. In the second slot, input your new one. Press benchmark.

There should be a pretty big difference in signatures, and it should look something like this: ![https://imgur.com/6kOpTCv](https://i.imgur.com/6kOpTCv.png)

You are now done!

***

## Step 8: Injecting

Find any decent injector (like [Extreme Injector](http://www.extreme-injector.com/#:~:text=Extreme%20Injector%20is%20a%20small,the%20hacking%20of%20computer%20games.), [Xenos](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/124013-xenos-injector-v2-3-2-a.html) or the [GH Injector](https://guidedhacking.com/resources/guided-hacking-dll-injector.4/), really anything with manual mapping). Select your finished DLL, and inject!

I also reccomend you use the [VAC Bypass Loader](https://matt12945.gitbook.io/csgo-subreddit/free-and-pastes/vacbypass) as it will also greatly reduce your chances of being banned with any cheat.

Don't share the cheat with very many people or VAC may start detecting it. Also, do these steps again every now and then to change the signature and get any new updates your source may have.

Enjoy!

First of all, if you did decide to use a source code obfuscator, make sure you use that first before you compile because it probably wont work on your finished build of the cheat. Once you have ran it, press Local Windows Debugger to compile.

Next, go into your project folder, Release, and rename the DLL inside to whatever you want your cheat to be called \(ex. RainbowWare\).

If you decided to get VMProtect, run that on your DLL. Take the outputted one, and now we will test the signatures!

Open up SigBench. In the first slot, input the original DLL from earlier. In the second slot, input your new one. Press benchmark.

There should be a pretty big difference in signatures, and it should look something like this: ![SigBench after a scan](https://i.imgur.com/6kOpTCv.png)

You are now done!

### Step 8: Injecting

Find any decent injector \(like [Extreme Injector](http://www.extreme-injector.com/#:~:text=Extreme%20Injector%20is%20a%20small,the%20hacking%20of%20computer%20games.), [Xenos](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/124013-xenos-injector-v2-3-2-a.html) or the [GH Injector](https://guidedhacking.com/resources/guided-hacking-dll-injector.4/), really anything with manual mapping\). Select your finished DLL, and inject!

Don't share the cheat with very many people or VAC may start detecting it. Also, do these steps again every now and then to change the signature and get any new updates your source may have.

Enjoy!

# Ratpoison

-- Link: [https://github.com/TheFuckingRat/RatPoison/](https://github.com/TheFuckingRat/RatPoison/) Download zip, unzip it, run build.bat and type Y or N depending on whether you have the JDK \(not the JRE\). It will handle installing the JDK for you, then build the cheat. The cheat will then be in the /build/Ratpoison \(version number\)/ folder. Open CSGO, then run the bat file. It is an external, but it binds to the csgo.exe window so the menu shows up on top. Also, the default menu key is F1. Do not ask for a legit config. It is not difficult to create one yourself, not to mention everyone's idea of "legit" and what they personally want on and off in each cheat changes.

## Load into [this map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) and change the settings until you get it just the way you like it.

Ratpoison is an external legit cheat that was forked from charlatano\(Which also is a great external cheat that hasn't been detected for a long time.\), written in Java. It hasn't been detected for 3 years, and it's source is available on Github. It is highly recommended to newcomers who don't have programming experience.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 7 or above \(Overlay is only available on Windows 10\)
* \(Optional\) Java Development Kit 13 [How to install JDK 13?](https://tubemint.com/install-java-jdk/)

## How to set up

Head over to [their Github repository](https://github.com/TheFuckingRat/RatPoison/)

Click on "Clone or Download", then in the drop-down window, click download as zip. ![ratpdownload](https://prnt.sc/t3w2q0)

After you downloaded the zip file, unzip to a random folder, but we recommend that folder name should not have:

* spaces
* symbols that don't exist in ASCII table \(No random words\)

After you unzip it, you should be able to see the folder structure like this: \[TODO:Inject photos\]

Click on build.bat. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

After you click on build.bat, a command prompt window will show up, and ask if you have the JDK installed. Type Y or N depending on whether you have the JDK \(not the JRE\). It will handle installing the JDK for you, then compile the cheat. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

The cheat will then be in the \build\Ratpoison \(version number\) folder. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

After you compiled the cheat, you need to run CSGO first, then run the .bat file inside the output folder mentioned above.

Since it is an external, but it binds to the csgo.exe the menu shows up on top. Also, the default menu key is F1. \[TODO:Inject photos\]

We recommend to load into this map [Aim Botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) and try to mess around with the settings, until you find the best legit config that works best for you. If you can't set it up, we will make a basic legit config in a later section.

# VAC-bypass

VAC bypasser is a VAC bypass module that blocks VAC from running. This could allow any detected cheats \(i.e: OTC v3\) to be injected to the game witout the risk of getting VAC detection banned.

## How does it work?

According to the github description, it's trying to make the function `Utils_getSystemInformation` inside VAC to return `false`, so it will stop scanning for cheats.

## How to install it?

* Warning: Installing VAC-bypass requires compiling the source code from your own! Please install Visual Studio 2019 with Visual C++ toolchain first.
* Also antivirsus software will report a false alarm on your compiled program. You can ignore as it is safe to use. However this only applies to the program you compiled from the github source.

First, head to the VAC-bypass loader's [github page](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/VAC-Bypass-Loader):

Then download the project to youre folder. After that, fire up the .sln file:

Once the project is fully loaded, change build configuration on top of the menu bar to Release \| x86UI.AddCheckbox\( \[ path \], name \);

Finally, simply press Build solution on solution explorer.

Once the compile is successfully, head to the Release folder on your downloaded project file:

Then click on "VAC-bypass-loader.exe". Make sure you have closed steam before opening it due to the program will inject the module into steam.

Once it is successful, you will see a window pop up that says "VAC-bypass loaded successfully!". Simply click on enter and steam login window will show up. Enter your username and password as usual.

And vollia! You an inject any VAC-detected cheats as you want. However once you shut down steam, you have to re-run the loader again.

# Common spots for different maps

In this section we will explain and show you how to use certain spots on maps to your advantage in hvh games, some of these spots are known as "1 ways" which just means you can only shoot through the wall/spot in one direction. Other spots are more common/good spots to hold when defending a bomb site/hostage or when attacking a bomb site.

Here we will cover the common spots for HvHing in dust 2 \(Old\).

## A long

### Pit

* Type: 1 way
* Against: A site \(Visible part\) + Bedroom + Car
* Possible to defeat?: No

Holding pit whilst fakeducking on dust 2 \(Old\) if played correctly is one of if not the best 1 way present on this map. Its a simple angle to hold and can fetch you alot of kills on newer players who rush pit every round. Playing this postion against more knowledgable people is harder however still possible. You will commonly find people throwing HE grenades or molotov's at you, As soon as they start throwing nades throw wait 1-2s then throwdown a smoke this ensures that you don't take that much damage but have the smoke last longer. In the process of throwing the smoke people will push you \(most of the time\) and give you a chance to fakeduck, move up and get some kills.

# Dust2

Here we will cover the common spots for HvHing in dust 2.

## CT spawn

### CT box 1

* Type: 1 way
* Against: B site + specific posisiton in mid + A long
* Possible to defeat?: Yes

The right side box at CT spawn is a good 1 way to shoot players who try to cross B doors or trying to cross mid in specific angles. You can try to activate minium damage override when the emeny player is does not come out and holding the edge of B doors. You have two place to stand, one is simply standing next to the box, while one is step on the box, which sometimes could damage players in mid if their position is too close to the wall at CT spawn, or players from A long. Just be sure you're crouching when stepping on top of the box.

To defeat players holding this position, you have to go to mid and try to close to the wall on your left when coming out of mid doors. With the help of gernade helpers, it is possible throw nades to this position.

### CT box 2

* Type: 1 way
* Against: B site + A long
* Possible to defeat?: Yes

The further box at CT spawn is also good 1 way to shoot players who try to cross B doors or trying to cross mid in specific angles. You can try to activate minium damage override when the emeny player is does not come out and holding the edge of B doors. In order to do so, simply step on top of the box and you're done. In this position, be sure to let your real angles hide inside the box and let the fake angles exposed into b doors. Using maual anti-aim position could do the job.

To defeat players holding this position, you have to go to mid and try to close to the wall on your left when coming out of mid doors. With the help of gernade helpers, it is possible throw nades to this position.

### CT spawn walls

* Type: 1 way
* Against: A short
* Possible to defeat?: Yes

The second pillar at CT spawn is useful when the enemy team trying to cross A short to A site. All you need to do is stand close to the pillar and you're done. However this only applies to

To defeat players holding this position, you have to go to mid and try to close to the wall on your left when coming out of mid doors. With the help of gernade helpers, it is possible throw nades to this position.

## Middle

### Barrels

* Type: \(half\) 1 way
* Against: CT spawn to mid
* Possible to defeat?: Yes

## B Site

### Box to b-site tunnel

* Type: 1 way
* Against: B site tunnel
* Possible to defeat?: Yes

### Window

* Type: 1 way
* Against: From mid to b site tunnel, depends on your position
* Possible to defeat?: Yes

## General

After selecting your ideal cheat, setting up your HvH config, and want to try out If this is your first time to try HvH, you might be overwhelmed by a lot of concepts in the HvH scene, like 1 ways, epeek, stack and so on.

## Concepts

In fact, the core copncept of HvHing in CSGO falls to the common idea of HvH: the race to be the fastest people to make damage to other players while trying to protect yourself from doing so. In short, all you need to do is to treat HvH as a movement game, and trying to move to positions that advatnages you.

## Matchmaking HvH vs Community HvH servers

There are some differences from community hvh and matchmaking hvh games. In community HvH it's more about your movement and the use of exploits, while in matchmaking you have the consider more items, including economy, team collaberation and the use of nades.

In community hvh, there are expolits \(doubletap, hide shots\) that could give you insane advantage when playing HvH. Also AWPs are banned in a lot of these community servers since it is too broken.Besides, community mostly will provide all maxium money at round start, this could allow players to train for their playstyle with autosnipers or scouts.

However in matchmaking HvH, there are more events that requires to take account for. The most critical part is the economy. Without any exploits \(Which there are, but not as useful as in community HvH servers\), making every shot you make could made a difference. Hence, the AWP would be the recommended weapon when playing matchmaking HvH. Having CSGO economy knowledge would give you advantages. If you run a good economy strategy, you could make a comeback even you lose in the beginning. Secondlly, unless you are playing with your friends, you will often finding you are the only cheater in your team while the enemy team got multiple cheaters. Thus this will require teamwork and strong communication on economy and throwing nades at the right timing. This is not something required in community hvh servers.

# Cheat Features

* Aimbot - An aimbot is a software tool that allow the player to shoot enemies without having to aim their weapon. In most cheat software there are two types of aimbot: Legit and rage aimbot. The legit aimbot will also provide a smoothing function, which determines the speed of the aimbot moves the aim to the enemy's head or any other selected hitbox. As for a rage aimbot, it just behaves like a general aimbot, but it does immediately snap to the enemy's head.
* Hitbox priority - In general, a playermodel hitbox is divided into different parts to the playermodel, in order to calculate the damage from the player
* Recoil Control System \(RCS\) - Helps you control the recoil of the gun. Some cheats also comes with a standalone RCS, what it means is that the RCS will not be affected by the aimbot.
* Anti-Aim \(AA\) - Also known as "Spinbot" by normal CS players. In CSGO, a viewangle is made from 3 basic elements:
  * Pitch \(Rotation along the X axis\)
  * Yaw   \(Rotation along the Y axis\)
  * Roll  \(Rotation along the Z axis\)

As we mentioned before, the way a aimbot \(What we are talking about here is rage aimbot\) works is by moving your crosshair to the enemy's head. So how anti-aim works, is to modify the angle of the playermodel's head by editing the values in pitch, yaw or roll, so that the aimbot will need to calculate the angle of the enemy's head, causing the chances of getting hit will be lower. One of the popular anti-aim, which is used to be spinbot, is achieved by modifying the yaw angle from -180 to 180 in one second, causing the playermodel looks like spinning. However nowadays the most common type of anti-aim are emotion \(45 degrees\) on pitch with static desync or jitter.

![This is what csgo hvh scene anti-aim be like. The playermodel&apos;s head looking down and their body may facing to the direction of the wall.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M2Tvf0EOXik/maxresdefault.jpg)

* Legit Anti-Aim - Legit anti-aim is similar to anti-aim, but with a smaller angle. It is achieved by using desync to a maximum of 58 degrees. Thus the playermodel will still look like normal, but the real hitbox is being shifted to a different angle. Also, most cheat provides also use a LBY breaker in order to achieve 118 degrees of legit anti-aim.

  ![This is how legit anti-aim looks like. The green part is what other players will see and the part is where the actual hitbox and playermodel is located. ](https://i.imgur.com/MgQ1jpJ.png)

* Silent aim - Silent aim will allow you to freely move your character without having to look to the enemy and not snapping your corsshair onto the enmeny's head instantly. In the past, there was also a server-side silent-aim, which means other players will also see you are not snapping onto other player's head. However that was patched, and now there is only client-side silent aim available, which means in overwatch or demo, they will see you snap onto other player's head instantly.
* Spread / NoSpread - All weapons have spread in CSGO. So what NoSpread does is to remove all the bullet spread in the game, no matter when you are jumping, walking or running. It is only available in community servers.
* LBY - A short term for lower body yaw.
* Desync - An exploit abusing critical game mechanics to desynchronize the real hitbox\(where shots are registered\) from the fake player model\(where cheats will shoot without proper resolving, preventing shots from registering\).
* Resolver - The resolver in a cheat, tries to calculate where an enemy's real head is. This can be really hard because some cheats got a decent AA which makes it harder for the resolver to figure out where to shoot.
* Backtrack - An exploit which allows you to shoot at where a certain player was and still hit them. Usually is configured in ticks or ms, with a maximum of 400ms.

In CSGO, in order to reduce latency between client and the server, a tick system is designed. What it does is the client will collect all the local data, compressed it as a tick and send it to the server. Then the server collects the ticks from different client in a specified time limit \(which is 64 tick in official valve servers while some community server servers will set to 128 tick.\), then send the calculated result to the clients. Thus the client is always several ticks ahead from the server, the tick which is used to determine the hitbox is the first tick chocked from the client. And what backtrack does is by broadcast a history recorded tick to the server. This is also used in fake angles, which is achieved by broadcasting a fake tick to other client from the server, however this got patched in 2018.

* FakeLag - Will let the players look like freezing between frames. It works similar to using a lag switch.
* ESP - Also know as "walls /wall hacking / visual assistance". Which allows the user to see through a player whether it is an enemy or an teammate through various obstacle such as walls, smoke, etc. Most ESP provide multiple options for the user to set up, such as shading the playermodel, types of ESP, or what object should be seen through.
* ASUS Walls - A cheat feature which allows you to see through specific walls. It was achieved by exploiting a driver provided by ASUS before, which allows to control the transparency of specific materials / textures.
* Fast stop - This allows the player to stop close to immediately.
* Fast duck/unlimited duck - exploit that breaks crouch stamina
* Name stealer - Will allow the player to steal other player's name, so that the player will not get kicked. Mostly useful when a cheater is raging in casual gamemodes or community servers.
* Inventory unlock: In competitive mode, you're not allowed to change your weapon choice once the match was started. With inventory unlock, you can access the inventory panel while the match is being played.
* Smoothing - affects the speed at which the aimbot aims to the enemy
* RCS - recoil control system
* Exploits - By abusing the tickrate system in CSGO, we can have two exploits that could be used when playing HvH:
  * Doubletap. This will attempt to shoot two shots into one game tick, giving you a faster firerate, which would allow to kill enemy players faster. However the price would be sacrificing the accuracy, causing missing shot due to weapon spread. However this will not work with fakelag, thus fakelag will be diabled when using doubletap. Doubletap could be used in valve matchmaking servers, but won't be useful as you would use in hvh servers.
  * Hide shots. This will disable fakelag when you are shooting to the desired direction. With fakelag enabled, you "onshot" state will preserve longer and thus allowing enemy players to shoot you through the head easily as when you are shooting there is no anti-aim. However both doubletap and hide shots could not be used together.

## Visuals

Here we will explain the features that isn't self-explaintoary.

* Chams - colours playermodels and/or changes their materials.
* Traceline - draws a line from your model to the type of person specified
* Draw FOV - shows the FOV of your aimbot
* Playermodel FOV - alters your playermodel FOV \(makes ur hands further/closer\)
* Backtrack chams / History Chams - shows an enemie’s location history, and where they can be backtracked to.
* Flags \(common ones include: money, flashed, distance, etc.\) : draws text next to a person if they meet a condition of the flag \(e.g. if a person is flashed then the “flashed” text will appear on your esp next to them\), or displays the info specified \(e.g “Money” simply shows you the amount of money a person has.”
* Spread circle - shows the weapon spread
* Grenade Helper - shows the path of your grenade before you throw it
* Damage indicators - shows damage you did to an enemy
* Knife/Zeus range - draws the range that the knife or zeus can do damage in around your playermodel \(useful in thirdperson\)

## Misc

* Autostrafe - automatically strafes for you. Looks like you are doing nothing on your screen.
* Slide walk - makes your playermodel slide when walking.
* Auto accept - Automatically accepts when a match is found

## Private features

You should know these features despite it might be an impossible task for you to achieve one as a non-coder.

* Server lagger: Lags the server.
* Server crasher: Crashes the server.

# Frequently asked questions

Here we will be answering frequently asked questions related to CS:GO cheating.

## Game bans and trust factor

* Q: How do I remove a VAC or Overwatch ban? 

A: **You can't**. [Read here for more information]()

* Q: What to do when I got banned? Will it affect my main accounts and so on? I don't want to lose my inventory!

A: In short, VAC only affects accounts that you have cheated on and [accounts with phone connected.](https://support.steampowered.com/kb/7849-RADZ-6869/). [Check out our unfinished guide for further information.](../miscellaneous/things-to-do-when-your-account-got-banned.md)

* Q: How to improve my turst factor?

A: [Check out our unfinished guide.](../miscellaneous/trust-factor.md)

* Q: I do not cheat and I just saw a spinbotter in my game. What is the fastest way to get him banned?

A: Currently it is kinda difficult to do so as both trust factor and overwatch just being repaired and they are working slowly.

## Cheats

* Q: What is the best free cheat for HvH?

A: To be honest, all free HvH cheats will severly underperform compared to popular paid cheats. However, if you must use a free cheat, you can try [Onetap crack](https://github.com/csgohacks/master-guide/tree/ac1524cb43dcd48d22efc3a2cd10c4323464d8f3/free-and-pastes/cracks/onetap-crack/README.md) or [LuckyCharms](../free-and-pastes/luckycharms/).

* Q: What is the best paid cheat for HvH?

A: This is largely a matter of opinion, and I advise you to make that decision for yourself. You can look at information about paid HvH cheats in the section below.

* Q: What is the best free legit cheat?

A: Ratpoison, because as of right now it **cannot** be detected. Osiris is a good to paste from if you are making a legit paste, whcich both cheats are covered at [here]().

* Q: How about linux and macOS?

A: [Check out some examples we covered at here.](../cheat-software/linux-and-mac-cheats.md).

* Q: I saw \[Insert hvh youtuber name here\] recommending a cheat. Shall I buy one?

A: Unless he/she is recommending some popular p2c\(s\), then you should be safe. However it is recommended to [check out this list](../cheat-software/pastes-and-scams.md) to avoid these scams. Those scams would only wasting your time on trying it.

## Cheat configuration

* Q: I saw \[Insert hvh youtuber name here\] dominating the HvH server with his purchasable config. Shall I buy one?

A: [No](../cheat-configuration/introduction/paid-configurations.md). Despite there might be a few of them that actually works, but as a newcomer, we do not recommend buying any configs as they won't do anything if you don't know what to do.

* Q: Are scripts useful? I think they are just scam!

A: Yes a lot of them are kind of useless. That said there are some scripts would actually enhance the cheat's functionallity. Generally if you don't know how the script would enhance your cheating experience, don't buy it.

# Game Bans

There are several types of game ban in CS:GO :

## VAC

Mostly happens when you used a detected cheat. These kind of bans are permanent, and you lose your inventory and cannot play matchmaking. HvH servers are fine though, because they always have VAC deactivated.

## Overwatch Ban

Overwatch bans are manual bans where players watch your demos and ban you.

## Griefing ban

Griefing bans are overwatch bans that are "minor", will last 30 days the first time, but will turn permanent if you get it twice.

## Untrusted

Untrusted bans are similar to a VAC ban; permanent and skins are locked. Most cheats don't have untrusted bans. These bans can be caused due to features used in for example AimStep\(Arms Race, Deathmatch and such\) but every good cheat prevents the use of those features.

`introduction/terminology-of-csgo-cheating.md`:

# Terminology of csgo cheating

These are the terms that are commonly used in the CS:GO cheating community:

## Cheat Software-related

* P2C - Cheat software that requires the user to pay for it.
* F2C - Cheat software that don't requires the user to pay for it.
* Paste - Cheats that use code which isn't written by them. However most of them behave quite bad and the chances of getting detected by anti-cheat software are very high. Also some scammers would use them as a base to scam people. However people also use this term in order to insult a cheat provider.
* Crack - Cheats that used to be paid but now being accessible for free because of a vulnerability found in their security.
* Config - The configuration for the cheat. Most of the cheats in CS:GO provide a lot of features for the user to set up. A configuration file allows the user to load up pre-configurated settings to the cheat, reduces the time to set up the cheat all over again.
* Lua/js - Some cheat providers also allow their community to create some scripts in order to let the cheat behave how the user-wanted. This could allow the user to make the cheat more flexible. Most of the scripts are written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), however some cheat providers provide a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) API, therefore there are also scripts are written in JavaScript \(JS for short\).

## Cheating styles

* Closet - Cheaters who tries to hide up their cheat to a maximum level in order to not get called out from other people. Mostly they will only turn on a few features, such as only toggle up a little bit of aim-assist, or a high smooth value of legit aimbot, sometimes they will also toggle up airstrafe and auto bunnyhop.
* Legit - Which is similar to a closet cheater, who tries to play like a normal player. However the difference with closet cheaters are they will turn on more features compared to closet cheaters, such as ESP.
* Blatant - Cheaters who turns on features that other players will notice that the cheater is cheating such as triggerbot, esp, or somteimes rage aimbot. They will have a higher chance of getting banned.
* Rage - Cheaters will turn on most of the features that the cheat has available in order to win a match by any cost, such as Anti-Aim, rage aimbot, esp, etc. Mostly they will receive a ban in a day or in a week, depends on how long overwatch takes or the cheat gets detected by the anti-cheat software.

## In game

* HvH - A short term for "Hack-versus-Hack". In these cases, the cheaters on both sides will load up their rage configuration in order to win the match. Mostly seen on non-prime level 2 accounts.
* Legit HvH - Simlar to HvH, but in this case, the cheater on both sides will only toggle their blatant configuration, since they don't want to have the risk of a ban \(Despite the chances of getting banned on legit HvH are very high\). Mostly seen on non-prime or prime MM.
* P / p100 - A term to represent something is very good, near perfection. For example, when a cheater typed "hitting p" in chat, this means his ragebot always hits the target, running nearly perfect. Or when some cheater says "p media", which means this is some excellent sources to be used in a video / photo etc...
* 1 - Killing the enemy with one shot \(headshot\)
* Baim - Stands for "Body-aim".
* Sliding - When a cheater toggles side walk, other players will see the legs of the cheater's playermodel become frozen, looks like sliding.

![Example of a player sliding.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/GaseousUnluckyAnophelesmosquito-size_restricted.gif)

* Dumping fake - Person not being able to hit the enemy while hvhing, shooting their fake body and head. This is usually due to the resolver of the cheat not being able to keep up with another's Anti-Aim.

## Community

* Trashtalking - Mostly happens during a HvH or before a HvH match. In order to make another cheater become angry and may toggle his rage cheat configuration.
* NN - Short term for "No-namer". Which stands for a cheater that nobody knows him. Mostly used as an insult to another cheater.
* Big namer - Antonym of "no-namer"; a big namer is someone who is famous in the HvH community, which usually is someone good at HvH and posts media on different social media platforms regularly.
* cya@media - similar as people "Hello youtube", which is use as to notify another player / cheat that he is going to be on public media.
* uff ja - "Yes" in german. Just a expression used in the end of a sentence. Firstly used by root back in 2009 in CS:S days when he was trying to sell his cheat with the moto: "We can and we will, uff yaa $".
* hhhh - Arabic slang means for "Ha Ha Ha", a representation of laughing.
* laff - A HvH slang stands for laugh.
* n1 - A HvH slang. Stands for "nice one".
* who.ru - A HvH slang represents "who are you".
* ks omk - Arabic swear word, literal meaning is "your mothers vagina". One of the strongest and harshest swear words in arabic language, anyone will get triggered by it.
* ga7ba - Arabic swear word, meaning "whore".
* sharmoota - Synonym of "ga7ba", also meaning "whore".
* gondon - Russian swear word, meaning "prick"
* pizda - Russian swear word, meaning "vagina"
* pizdetc - Russian swear word, meaning "pussy". Usually used on men.

* All theese testimonials does not represnt the offical statment of the r/csgohacks subreddit.

### Legitbot

* Highly adjustable option, which means will take time to configure
* Smooth aimbot
* Dymanic triggerbot

### Ragebot

* Anti-Aim is wacky, however a recent update brings a god-like anti-aim method to aimware. --TODO
* Reslover is extremely un-optimized, causing FPS drop often.

### Visuals

-- TODO: Insert ESP demo

* Information-rich ESP \(Hostages, C4, dropped weapons, etc\)
* Highly customizable option, which means will take time to configure
* Charms are not very favourable by most users.

### Miscellaneous

* Skinchanger and Modelchanger are available. \(Modelchanger requires bypass `sv_pure`\)
* A feature-rich LUA API which users can create their LUA scripts to customize the cheat's behaviour 
* Cannot use `sv_cheats 1` command in csgo without turing off Anti-Untrusted in Miscellaneous
* A live LUA editor is available in v5.

### Config

* In .cfg file format, However not text-editable.
* Config files are located at a generated folder with random text at %appdata%
* LUAs are in .lua file format as a normal LUA script, text-editable

### Services

* Moderators barely reply
* False bans happened often
* HWID resets take days or more, while not 100% gurantee success.

  > The staff is probably the worst part about the cheat, they often don't know what they are doing and are known to ignore HWID resets for no reason, the staff will claim that the resolver is perfect and is known for "config issue /thread closed" and they are known to ban quite easily, so be careful with the staff. ---[u/manofeverything](https://www.reddit.com/r/Csgohacks/comments/farrad/i_need_your_feedback/fj03tnh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

### Overall

* Decent legitbot
* Improved ragebot
* Meh Visuals
* Feature-rich miscellaneous options
* Bad customer services
* Still worthy for a lifetime subscription for it's name and stability.

# Menu introduction

Here we will walkthrough all the features inside neverlose.

## General

![](https://i.imgur.com/JVV5vfz.png)

If you used spirthack before, you will find both cheat's layout are similar. As you seen from the menu, the left panel is neverlose's navigation panel which allows you to navigate through different tabs of the cheat. On the bottom right, you can see your username and your subscription due date.

### Searching

If you would like to search for specific feature, you can click on the "search" button on the top right.

## Legitbot

![](https://i.imgur.com/JVV5vfz.png)

### Main

General settings for legitbot.

* Enable legitbot: Toggles on/off the legit bot
* Activation: Determines when to activate the legitbot:
  * Hotkey: When pressed on the defined hotkey, it will activate the legitbot
  * Always: Always enable the legitbot
* Hotkey: Here you can set which key would activate when you choose "Hotkey" in activation.
* Disable aimbot if: Force the cheat to diable aimbot when specific conditions are matched:
  * Flashed: Disable aimbot when you get flashed.
  * Enemy In Smoke: Disable aimbot when the emeny player is inside a smoke.
  * In Jump: Disable aimbot when you jumping.
* Backtracking: Allows you to hit the player in their previous X ms postion.
* Draw fov: Draws the aimbot FOV on your screen. The aimbot FOV means the aimbot will shoot players within the FOV circle.
* Autopistol: Automatically fires your pistol to the enemy inside the fov.

### Fitst bullet

Settings for how the first bullet should behaviour.

* FOV: The field-of-view that the aimbot would see on the first bullet.
* Smooth: How "smooth" the aimbot should drag the crosshair to the target enemy player. The higher the smoooth value, the slower the aimbot dragging the crosshair.

### Other bullets

Settings for how other bullets should behaviour after the first few shots. When spraying with full auto weapons, \(rifles, smgs etc\) it will be activated after 3~5 bullets, while tapping/2-3 round burst with a rifle it will only be using first bullet settings.

However keep in mind that spamming with a pistol it won't use other bullet settings.

* Use first bullet settings: Copies the settings for FOV and smoothing you set in "First bullet".
* FOV: The field-of-view that the aimbot would see on the first bullet.
* Smooth: How "smooth" the aimbot should drag the crosshair to the target enemy player. The higher the smoooth value, the slower the aimbot dragging the crosshair.

### Recoil control

Settings on Recoil control system \(RCS\)

* Enable RCS: Enable the Recoil control system, so that the cheat will helps your to control the recoil of the gun, thus allowing more accurate shots.
* Standalone RCS: The movement of RCS will not be affected by the aimbot. Generally aimbot and RCS are tied together, so that you could land your shots on enemy players more accurately. However this might cause trouble sometimes.
* Pitch: Overrides the default value for pitch when shooting.
* Yaw: Overrides the default value for yaw when shooting.

### Delay

Settings on the delay regarding the aimbot. The higher the value on both settings, the longer time it takes.

* After kill: How many microseconds to re-activate the aimbot after killing one enemy.
* First bullet delay: How many microseconds to re-activate the aimbot after the first shot was fired.

### Autofire

Similar to "Magnet Triggerbot" in other cheats. It will also aims to the player and shoots for you.

* Enabled: Enable autofire feature
* Hitchance: Determine the percentage condition that the cheat should open fire. The hight the value, the more accurate your shot and doing vice versa will makes your shot less accurate. However setting too high will cause the cheat too late to open fire.

### Autowall

Allowing the legitbot to shoot through walls that legit players would shoot.

* Enabled: Enable autowall feature.
* Minium damage: Determine the damage condition that the cheat should do autowall firing. The hight the value, the more high damager your shot will goes to the enemy player and doing vice versa will makes your shot less damage to the enemy. However setting too high might cause the cheat not to do so.

# CSGO Source Code leaks

In 22nd April 2020, a copy of CSGO's incomplete source code has been leaked into 4chan's page within Team Fortress 2's source code, a project that Tyler Mcvicker [\(A.K.A, Valve News Network\)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5RKbiAPqSC_mUIjCpx3xg)'s studio has been working on, and some images leading about Half-Life 3. \(Which is mostly public.\). Within hours, copies are being made across most popular cheating forums and mirrors are made on github and MEGA cloud. Despite valve took action immediately and serval mirrors are taken down, a lot of people have obtained the source code.

## Who did it?

### Controversial Section!

* This section describes a highly controversial event/item that may subject to change, you should NOT take this an absolute reference. By reading the following section, you are agreed that r/csgohacks and CSGO cheating masterguide contributors will not bear any reponsibility for any misleading information.

According to serval sources, a developer at "Lever Softworks", a studio owned by Tyler Mcvicker is responsible for this leak. The developer was doing this as a revenge to Tyler Mcvicker, who just fired him due to some confidential reasons.

## What's inside?

TODO

## Am I safe from this source code leak?

At the beginning of the leak, there are serval claimed that cathook, a Team Fortess 2 cheat for linux has successfully found a RCE \(Remote command exection\) exploit that allows the attacker to execute files to the victim's PC. However it turns out the videos are faked and the administrators of Cathook has clarified theese videos are not afficiated with cathook, there are still rumors that the is RCE exploits around for both games. Later that day, the developers of CSGO made a tweet to clarify there are no exploits are being undiscorved inside the leaked source code, as some CSGO reverse engineers have confirmed Valve's statement. So it's pretty sure to say that you're safe to play CSGO.

# How to start coding a cheat

If you decided to code your own cheat, then here are some information for you to know more about cheat development.

## How to code a cheat from zero experience?

In the words of a wise man:

![Thanks, rake!](https://i.imgur.com/LUN0Fdj.png)

If you are going to make a cheat, you should know that this is a time-consuming activity that involved lots of researching, reading error-finding and practicing. So if you are going to dream about making a gamesense-alike cheat within months, you can give up on cheat development.

It's a good life lesson in general, if you focus on the journey the result will come, and often times the reward is less sweet without the pain and suffering of the journey.

## Timeline for learning cheat development

* Learn the absolute basics of using Cheat Engine: 1 week
* Learn enough CE to use all it’s features, how to find pointers etc: 2 – 3 weeks
* Learn C++/C\# well enough to make a hello world and know the absolute basics of coding: 1 month
* Experienced enough to make very basic trainers in C++/C\#: 3 – 6 months
* Learn enough to make trainers with more advanced features like pattern scanning, teleporting etc: 6-12 months
* Intermediate coding/reversing skills to hack any game you want without anticheat: 1-2 Years
* Start reversing anticheat: 2 Years
* Mastering about Operating System internals \(Optional\): 1 ~ 2 Years.

## Tips when coding a cheat / learning cheat development

* Do not monetize your cheat without preparation. If you are going to make a cheat to make money and you have zero experience on it, sorry to burst your bubble but that's not going to happen. The developers behind major P2Cs are very experienced on cheat development, so if you're trying to monetize your half-baked product to the market, you're going to get a bunch of laughs and nothing.
* Feel free to ask! If you face any problems when learning game hacking, feel free to ask on various online platforms! However keep in mind that no one on the internet would like to spoon-fed you some obvious information. So we would recommend make sure you have done your own researches before asking.
* Practice! You have to practice more to improve your skills. The more time you invested on it, the more you will going to learn.
* Don't give up! Game hacking is a time-consuming research. Don't give up on some obstacles, try to solve it and at the end, you're going to gain some useful experiences.
* Do not look for frameworks at the beginning of learning! A lot of newcomers would face to a common problem is using libraries, or frameworks. This doesn't mean we don't encourage using libraries/frameworks, only if it is the only option, or the solution is beyond your knowledge. Using frameworks could definitely let your achieve your goal, but you're going to lose some experience on solving it. At the end you're not going learn anything from it.

## Useful resources

### Websites

* [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/): Since most cheats are written in C++, this website would teach you about the syntax and concepts of C++, which is extremely useful.
* [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): Codeacademy is a website that offers a lot of programming language for user to choose. Each programming language will have interactive lessons to let you doing exercises on it. A extremely useful website if you're going to learn about programming.
* [Guided Hacking](https://www.guidedhacking.com/): Guided Hacking is a good website if you want to learn about game hacking. In here you will going to learn about the basics of reverse engineering, cheat features \(aimbot, esp, etc\). A best place for inexperienced people who are interested in cheat development.
* [Unknowncheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/): Unknowncheats is a cheat developing forum that covers many PC games on the market. There are a lot of resources for cheat developers The community is helpful and active. You can ask about cheat development questions if you face any problems on researching or developing cheats.
* [Github \(aka gayhub\)](https://www.github.com/): You will find a lot useful resources in GitHub, similar to GitHub.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): A website for developers to ask questions, and answer questions about programming. You can always find various examples of different programming issues.
* Google: Yes, make use of Google’s search tools to find solutions before asking questions.
* x86 Assembly: Disassembler will decompile programs into some x86 assembly code \(The reason it's x86 assembly code is because the platform for most of the PC's no matter you're using Intel or AMD, are based on x86 architecture.\). Learning them could let you understand what the program is doing. There are a lot of sources available, feel free to google them.

### Tools

* Visual Studio: Visual Studio is an extremely powerful IDE for C++ development on Windows. A must have for cheat development.
* Cheat Engine: Cheat Engine is a useful tool that can let you modify the values of a running program. It is also a useful tool for newcomers to learn about the basic concepts of game hacking.
* IDA Pro / Ghidra: These are disassembler. Which is used to decompile programs for reverse engineering. If you could afford a license of IDA pro, then go for it since it's the most popular disassembler available on the market. Ghidra, which is developed by NSA, is a decent free alternative to IDA Pro.
* Extreme Injector: Extremely injector is a useful tool for users to inject their .dll files into a running process. It's has a user-friendly interface. Recommend for newcomers to use.

## Acknowledgements

* Guidedhacking for external support on introducing game hacking.

# Scams

In online world, there are a lot of people who would like to scam money from you, HvH community is no exception. There are a lot of scammers out there would like to scam money by claiming to having invites for private cheats, steam accounts, steam card selling, etc.

## Common scamming methods

[TODO:inject photos](scams.md)

Scammers would usually around at many famous HvH youtuber's discord server and sending DM's to random people, asking you are you interested in a specific goods, mostly an invitation for popular private cheats, such as gamesense or fatality. Sometimes, they will also posting on serval server's marketplace channel, claimed to offer you a private cheat invite/account/elling steam cards, or steam accounts, etc. Some users may asked for a proof, which the scammers will send out their already photoshopped photos, making the victim think it is legit. Then after the scammer receives the money from the victim, they will just run away, leaving the victim loss of money, and nowhere to help.

## How to avoid scams?

If you got a DM from people who claimed to have a gamesense/fatality invite, you should not reply to them. Since as we mentioned in [how to apply for private cheats section,](scams.md) invite selling will have a higher risk of getting banned. Besides, they don't actually have a invite, too. You can also ask them for extra information, such as UID \(User id, a number to identify a user\), first few words of their username, date of registered. Then you if you get two or more information from them, [head to this website](scams.md). This is a website running by us to verify these information are valid. If no, you should stay away from them.

If you really want a gamesense/fatality invite, which is STILL not recommended, you can go check out some high-reputation sellers from famous discord servers. Also, get yourself a middleman. A middleman will decreases you chances of getting banned. In [NASA\#9797's discord server](https://discord.gg/HQQW6Hc), or in [Our offical discord server](https://discord.gg/7ZkBrUN), there are serval people would offer their middleman services, but some of them need to pay for a small amount of fee.

## Extra: Avoiding RATs \(Remote Access Tool/Trojan\)

This should not counted as a scam, however sometimes some people also reported getting RATted, which means their PC got remote accessed illegally from other people by claiming have a in-development cheat that need people to try out, and having a .exe file attached. As we mentioned before, newcomers should stay away from lesser-known cheats first, due to a instability, higher chance of getting detected. So if the .exe file is lesser than a megabyte \(1MB\), then it will have a higher chance that this is a RAT program, which you should not open up, then you should report the user who send you the program to the moderator and to discord's trust and safety team.

![VAC banned](https://i.imgur.com/399ev4i.jpg)

If this is your first time encounter this message, don't worry! In this guide we will teach you things to do when you got your account banned.

## VAC bans

Before reading this page, you should check out the ![types of game bans at here](../.gitbook/assets/game-bans.md), which will cover most types of VAC bans. In short when your account is banned, you cannot:

* Play on VAC-secured servers in the game you have been banned,
* Cannot trade items on the game you have been banned.

## What can I do for it?

In short, there is nothing you can do when a game account got banned. However, you can still use a ![batch file](https://pastebin.com/KBCAf2Xt) which can helps you to remove all the steam account's data on your PC.

If you are raging with expensive inventory, it is highly recommend to transfer your inventory to a unlinked account.

## Final words

Always remember, there is no such "Undetectable cheat." Therefore, always prepare that chances are you will going to be banned by VAC when raging in VAC-secured servers.

## Extra: Avoid rumours

Never fall for "Overwatch bypass" or "VAC bypasses", which you cannot bypass them and it's mostly inreverseable, also most of them are scams or RATs \(Remote access torjans\). You can learn more abot these information ![at here.](../.gitbook/assets/scams.md)

# Trust Factor

## Trust Factor

### Disclaimer

This guide only show the results of serval individuals, and we are not going discuss how this works or suspecting it. Most of the experience here \(ie: bring accounts back from a bad trust factor to a high trust factor.\)

Also keep in mind that some accounts can NOT be brought back easily from a low trust factor to a high trust factor, they absolutely will not only take half an hour. However, you CAN bring it around with the methods below

These methods were tested across roughly 15 accounts \(individual accounts\), and 2 other accounts on a friends machine to rule out IP/HWID shenanigans. I used players with known perfect \(or close to\) trust factors, and the party warning, to test out the current state of my trust.

* THESE HAVE ALL BEEN PRIME ACCOUNTS, IF SOMEONE HAS VARYING RESULTS ON A NON PRIME I'D LIKE TO KNOW. Valve is constantly updating trust factor, so by the time you're reading this, it could be out of date.

I based the methods I chose mainly from the trust factor portion from this video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhK8lUfIlc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhK8lUfIlc) And running with the idea of how valve would logically determine a ' positive member of the CS:GO and Steam community.

### Methods to increase your trust factor

* Put money in your steam account: This is by far the quickest way to spike trust factor. This is mainly for bought accounts with nothing on them. Some people have reported instant jumps from red to yellow with forking over $7 USD to random items: skins, games, or even your steam profile items, etc.

In example: A player was on an account that only raged on 3 games with, and had been reported within one low trust factor game. So it can be assumed that the player's trust factor wasn't that 'low' on the red trust spectrum. Then the player paid $5 in skins and then start a party match, and ... it went yellow. So it can be concluded that putting money will 100% raise trust.

HOWEVER, this doesn't work on a linear scale, and we assume that valve has a logical approach to it. What does it means putting money will not always increase your trust factor. Take the aobve example. The player have already putting 5 USD into his steam account, causing his account's trust factor increased from red to yellow. However when the user decided putting another $7 into his steam account, it will not make him back into green, and neither did another $14 \(now 3x in th account's first jump\), so it can be assumed there is a base level in which money can raise from, in situations where the valve algorithm is using that as a decisive reason as to why your account is dodgy when you're reported. If you're on an account where you've spent thousands, and THEN dropped trust, we would be interested to know if injecting more cash fixes this.

NO CASH -- HIGH TRUST -- HALF AN HOUR - 2 HOURS \(unless you're a maaaaaaassive shit-cunt, sorry, it will take longer\). I use any combo of these methods, and then do a game and frag poorly, it has worked every time on accounts with shit-cunty behavior of around 10 games, hard core raging over a massive game span is going to be a lot harder. TODO: What is this?

STEAM DISCUSSIONS - I haven't really ever heard this one said along with the 'get commends' ect. But it seeeems to be one of the most consistent, whatever else i do, i always use this. This is because it's quick and easy and furthermore goes along with valve's statement "All you need to do is be a positive member of the CS:GO and Steam community. "

So literally being a 'positive' member of the community by contributing to the community tab- makes sense and the discussions is the easiest way to do this. Do NOT spam the discussions with total nonsense, there is a constant Jannie presence there, but don't stress too much... You can literally put zero effort into your responses. Just post random shit that is kind of related or reply with the first thing that pops into your head. Not sure if it matters, but personally I avoid one word responses. Don't stress about the cool down in between sending whatever-amount of messages... you should be doing the other methods below while you shit all over the discussion board with vaguely related shit to the random Peruvians posting questions in general about really specific games.

* Idle wizard - I call this my trust factor farmer, this is my least conclusive trust factor method in this section, but i cant leave it out because i literally always use it, because it costs me nothing.

I just have it on and running while i'm doing whatever else, while i walk my dog or whatever if I'm not trying to PUMP UP trust in rapid time. It's just a way for you to be in another game aside from cs:go.

My logic is that if you're on an account just to cheat you wont be playing other games, so a game that you won't get an idle status on- while costing next to no gpu/cpu usage- is a pretty good deal.

PLAY DA GAME - ... without getting reported... For some people this might be hard, especially if you're on a DMG account and you never graduated silver, BUT, i have never ever gotten my trust back to green, without first playing a game.

This is done after/during the above methods. Generally i will close CSGO, launch idle wizard while i post some steam discussions, re-open csgo, search... do more steam discussions, while i have idle wizard running. Don't worry about winning, don't grief, if you refuse to absolutely play without cheats, have radar on every FEW rounds, not all the time, and not at the start of the game.

People will usually have made their mind up if you're cheating by the first few time you're caught off guard going around a corner. Same with aimbot; just don't have it on all the time, but ideally you don't cheat at all. Just call out, or type friendly or whatever. don't fucking AWP your team mate's head off because he called you trash, deal with it.

2 games seems to be the general ballpark for accounts with pretty low accounts \(as in accounts that haven't just gone into low trust fresh, accounts that have probably been reported within low trust itself\). In silver you can probably just put on some music and never use mic, people don't really call there anyway. If you've been a lil closet bitch in MG+ and that's why you want to raise your trust, at least learn what counter strafing/peeking is, otherwise you'll go back down anyways. Alt tab while you're dead, chill out and don't let the games get to you.

DO NOT P QUEUE with this method- at least i didn't, not when i had my trust raise anyways, do what you want.

If your account is uber fucked and after 3 games it's still dogshit, try the above methods more, outside of playing more games and have idle wizard while you sleep/work/school.

SIDENOTE: could be coincidence, but have tried custom games \(arms race/death match\) and noticed no improvement whilst jumping into an actual competitive game made me shoot right back up.

## 2: time works- as in spending a long time outside of cs:go-  but dodgy accounts with cs as their only played game \(accounts valve would have a reason to suspect is a botted account\), probably doesn't, I'm not 100% sure of this but my experiences and others seems to come in ling with this. I am 100% sure that time in general does improve more legit accounts though.

## 3:team killing will FUCK your trust, hard.

### Myths when increasing your trust factor.

* Using commend bots: There are some people claimed that using commend bots to commend on your account can gain your trust factor, which isn't the case. The only thing it achieves is make you look stupid in low trust games.

Despite of that, commend bots are still useful if you are on a high trust factor and when trying to be a professional player.

* Idling in CSGO matches \(Deathmatch/ War games\):  Another common myth on increasing your trust factor is idling in various non-competitive matches can gain back your trust factor. However idling in cs:go in general doesn't work, despite we believed this myth comes from the fact that trust factor deteriorates over time in some cases.

Valve is constantly updating their shit, by the time you're reading this, it could be out of date.

# How to apply for private cheats

Private cheats are either invite only or application based. Don't beg for invites. Make friends with those that can get invites and NEVER ask directly. Invite based cheats are centered around the idea that the community chooses who gets in, while application based cheats are mostly for when the admins want to vet everyone who gets in, which is fair as well.

## Invites

Some private cheats have a invitation code for it's users so share out, in order to let their friends can join their community. However, some users find out it is a way to make some quick cash by selling invites. And soon, a lot of people followed. However, some of them are maybe scammers who claimed to have invite codes for sale, which we will cover [in a later page](https://github.com/csgohacks/master-guide/tree/5388cfff0303755162dea41a79a201fe0740199b/private-cheats/misc/README.md). However, the best way to get a invite code is to make friends, or make yourself famous in HvH servers by using public cheats first. Then someone will give you a private cheat invite soon after.

## Applications

There are private cheats allow applications for people to apply. Some of them have a limited application slot \(ev0lve\) while some didn't. Mostly if you made an application, which you have to introduce yourself, briefly, and most importantly, cheating experience. Then they will have an interview with you , mostly talking about your cheating experience. Usually if you don't behave rude during the interview and don't act like a prankster, also have some cheating experience they will usually let you join their community.

# Introduction

While there are public cheats available for general users to choose, but there are also some cheats decided to go private for various reasons.

## Advantages of staying private

* Lesser chances of being detected
* Making your cheat more famous, since not anyone can get one easily.

And here are some examples of private cheats.

## Skeet / Gamesense

![The logo of Gamesense.pub](https://i.imgur.com/7JO0tRh.png)

Gamesense.pub \(previously known as skeet.cc\) is a private cheat provider started from 2016. It is considered the top tier cheat provider in the CSGO cheating scene. The menu has been pointed as a standard for most startup cheat providers/self-coded cheats.

![The menu of gamesense.pub. ](https://i.imgur.com/AWQRRDE.png)

It has an un-hittable Anti-Aim and a 'godlike' resolver back during it's release. Despite nowdays there are lots of both private and public cheats started to comes up with gamesense, it's still considered the top cheat for CSGO. Invite only.

## Fatality

\[TODO:Fatality logo+menu\] Fatality.win is another private cheat provider started in 2018. It is a HvH-focused cheat, which means it is lacking of legit features. It has a \[insert\] anti-aim and a \[insert\] resolver. Invite only, and haven't received updates for a while.

## Novolinehook

![The logo of novolinehook.](https://i.imgur.com/fQBhoD4.png)

Novo.win \(Previously novolinehook.com\) is a German private cheat provider started in 2017. It is an excellent cheat for players who are aimed to closet, legit, or even semirage cheating. It is mostly known for its ability to stay undetected, and has dodged many of the recent waves.

![The menu of novolinehook.](https://image.prntscr.com/image/d3y5BHiwQ0eHrEgLJN2E8g.png)

Novoline also has a league, and a private vesion \(Hook of Ra\). League version supports VAC, SMAC, EAC, CEVO, ESL WIRE \(unstable\), and FaceIT Serverside. Also, NovolineHook has an decent staff support, with fast HWID resets and willing to offer you remote support in certain cases.

However the developers are reported to be lazy to push updates to the cheat. Also keep in mind that this is a legit-focused cheat, so you won't have a big chance against ragers. With that being said, it's resolver and legit anti-aim are still useful to fight against other semi-ragers.

This cheat is used to be open for application, however recently it has turned into invite only.

## Fanta

![Fanta menu](https://xtremecheats.gg/uploads/threads/thread_c4598093e0a7a240c7fce0defc23ecc3.jpeg) Fanta.club is a Private legit cheat provider which mostly focuses on its semi-rage aspects. Although there are rumours claimed it is pasted from gladiatorcheatz, it is still considered one of the best semirage cheat and is a competitor to Novoline. It has had its fair share of detections, but performance wise its really good. The community is active and the devs are less making updates for the cheat recently. Invite and applications are available.

## ev0lve

![evolvelogo](https://i.imgur.com/pBnYldx.png)

![Ev0lve menu](https://i.imgur.com/z1ybnxm.png)

ev0lve.xyz is a German private cheat provider that started back in 2015 as a invite only external legit cheat, it's since "evolved" into a well-developed internal HvH hack with loads of features also used outside of HvH, you could compare it to an HvH based cheat like Fatality with a few more legit features available. Application and invites are available, with limited application slots.

## Rifk7

![rifklogo](https://i.imgur.com/Exun366.png)

\[TODO:rifk7 menu\] Rifk7 is a private HvH cheat. Specially to mention the loader will plays music when opening it. Invites purchasable from admin. TODO

![nemesis menu](https://i.imgur.com/Oiv5hpv.png)

Nemesis.techonology is a cheat provider started in 20xx. Despite the cheat itself was cracked back in June 2020, however the crackers decided to make it paid only. Invite only.
