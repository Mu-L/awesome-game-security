      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Android Hidden Api Bypass

[![Android CI status](https://github.com/LSPosed/AndroidHiddenApiBypass/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/LSPosed/AndroidHiddenApiBypass/actions/workflows/android.yml)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-1.0%20--%2016-blue.svg)
![](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.lsposed.hiddenapibypass/hiddenapibypass.svg)

Bypass restrictions on non-SDK interfaces.

## Why HiddenApiBypass?

- Pure Java: no native code used.
- Reliable: does not rely on specific behaviors, so it will not be blocked like meta-reflection or `dexfile`.
- Stable: does not rely on internal ART structures on Android 10+. `Unsafe` and `setHiddenApiExemptions` are stable APIs.

## And LSPass?

- Fast: no I/O, initializing faster than HiddenApiBypass.
- Safe: no `Unsafe`.
- Unreliable: can be blocked as easily as meta-reflection.

## How it works

HiddenApiBypass: [Unsafe](https://lovesykun.cn/archives/android-hidden-api-bypass.html)

LSPass: [Property.of()](https://github.com/michalbednarski/LeakValue?tab=readme-ov-file#putting-it-all-together)

## Integration

Google Play doesn't allow apps to use hidden APIs, reporting library usage will cause your app to fail app review,
you need to disable dependencies info reporting in build.gradle.
Remember to update this library to latest version to be compatible with new Android version.

```gradle
android {
    dependenciesInfo {
        includeInApk = false
        includeInBundle = false
    }
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.lsposed.hiddenapibypass:hiddenapibypass:+'
}
```

## Usage

This library has two variants of bypassing, they have the same API.
When initializing, LSPass is faster than HiddenApiBypass, but LSPass maybe blocked in future Android releases.
Replace `HiddenApiBypass` with `LSPass` if you do not want to use `Unsafe`.

1. Invoke a restricted method:
    ```java
    HiddenApiBypass.invoke(ApplicationInfo.class, new ApplicationInfo(), "usesNonSdkApi"/*, args*/)
    ```
1. Invoke restricted constructor:
    ```java
    Object instance = HiddenApiBypass.newInstance(Class.forName("android.app.IActivityManager$Default")/*, args*/);
    ```
1. Get all methods including restricted ones from a class:
    ```java
    var allMethods = HiddenApiBypass.getDeclaredMethods(ApplicationInfo.class);
    ((Method).stream(allMethods).filter(e -> e.getName().equals("usesNonSdkApi")).findFirst().get()).invoke(new ApplicationInfo());
    ```
1. Get all non-static fields including restricted ones from a class:
    ```java
    var allInstanceFields = HiddenApiBypass.getInstanceFields(ApplicationInfo.class);
    ((Method).stream(allInstanceFields).filter(e -> e.getName().equals("longVersionCode")).findFirst().get()).get(new ApplicationInfo());
    ```
1. Get all static fields including restricted ones from a class:
    ```java
    var allStaticFields = HiddenApiBypass.getStaticFields(ApplicationInfo.class);
    ((Method).stream(allStaticFields).filter(e -> e.getName().equals("HIDDEN_API_ENFORCEMENT_DEFAULT")).findFirst().get()).get(null);
    ```
1. Get specific class method or class constructor
    ```java
    var ctor = HiddenApiBypass.getDeclaredConstructor(ClipDrawable.class /*, args */);
    var method = HiddenApiBypass.getDeclaredMethod(ApplicationInfo.class, "getHiddenApiEnforcementPolicy" /*, args */);
    ```
1. Add a class to exemption list:
    ```java
    HiddenApiBypass.addHiddenApiExemptions(
        "Landroid/content/pm/ApplicationInfo;", // one specific class
        "Ldalvik/system", // all classes in packages dalvik.system
        "Lx" // all classes whose full name is started with x
    );
    ```
    if you are going to add all classes to exemption list, just leave an empty prefix:
    ```java
    HiddenApiBypass.addHiddenApiExemptions("");
    ```

#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh Gradle
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,
#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;
#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.
#
#       The "traditional" practice of packing multiple parameters into a
#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security
#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating
#       options in "$@", and eventually passing that to Java.
#
#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,
#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;
#       see the in-line comments for details.
#
#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,
#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.
#
#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/platforms/jvm/plugins-application/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
