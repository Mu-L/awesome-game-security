# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
microdaika1@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

# Contributing to WindMouse

🎉 **Thank you for your interest in contributing to WindMouse!** 🎉

We welcome all contributions-whether you're fixing a bug, improving documentation, adding new features, or suggesting enhancements. Every contribution helps make WindMouse better for everyone.

---

## Philosophy

WindMouse aims to provide a clean, efficient, and extensible implementation of human-like mouse movement. We value:

- **Simplicity**: Code should be easy to understand and maintain
- **Performance**: Movements should be smooth and efficient
- **Developer Experience**: Contributing should be straightforward and enjoyable

---

## Prerequisites

This project uses [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver. You'll need to have `uv` installed to work with this project.

### Installing uv

If you don't have `uv` installed yet, you can install it with:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Alternative (via pip):**
```bash
pip install uv
```

For more installation options, visit the [uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

---

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/windmouse.git
cd windmouse
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

With `uv`, setting up your development environment is incredibly fast:

```bash
# Sync all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
uv sync --all-groups
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
- Install all project dependencies
- Install development tools (black, mypy)
- Install optional dependencies (pyautogui, ahk)

**Alternative: Install only core dependencies**
```bash
uv sync
```

**Alternative: Install with specific dependency groups**
```bash
# Just pyautogui support
uv sync --group pyautogui --group dev

# Just ahk support (Windows only)
uv sync --group ahk --group dev
```

---

## Working with the Code

### Running Scripts

You can run Python scripts in the project environment using:

```bash
uv run python your_script.py
```

Or activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python your_script.py
```

### ⚠️ Important Warning

**Be careful when running tests or example scripts!** This library controls mouse movement, which means:

- Your mouse **will move** automatically during execution
- This can interfere with your work or cause unexpected clicks

---

## Code Quality

We use industry-standard tools to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Code Formatting with Black

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) with a line length of 79 characters:

```bash
# Format all code
uv run black src/

# Check formatting without making changes
uv run black --check src/
```

### Type Checking with mypy

We enforce strict type checking:

```bash
# Run type checker
uv run mypy src/
```

### Before Submitting a PR

Make sure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Format code
uv run black src/

# Type check
uv run mypy src/
```

---

## Running Tests

> **Note**: At the time of writing, the project doesn't have automated tests yet. This is a great area where contributions are welcome! If you'd like to help set up a testing framework (pytest, for example), please open an issue to discuss the approach.

If tests are added in the future:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

---

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, concise code
- Follow the existing code style (Black formatting, type hints)
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update documentation if you're changing behavior or adding features

### 3. Test Your Changes

- Manually test your changes (remember the mouse movement warning!)
- Ensure formatting and type checking pass:
  ```bash
  uv run black src/
  uv run mypy src/
  ```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write meaningful commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: descriptive message about what changed"
```

Good commit message examples:
- `feat: add support for custom easing functions`
- `fix: correct calculation in damped distance logic`
- `docs: update README with new examples`
- `refactor: simplify wind force calculation`

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then, open a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- A clear title describing the change
- A description explaining:
  - **What** changed
  - **Why** it was needed
  - **How** it works (if non-obvious)
- Any relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Closes #42")

`LICENSE`:

```
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

**WindMouse** is a Python library that generates human-like mouse movements to avoid bot detection in automation scripts. It implements the WindMouse algorithm, which creates realistic, non-linear trajectories with variable speed—mimicking natural human mouse behavior.

## Why WindMouse?

Traditional automation tools move the mouse in straight lines at constant speeds, making them easy to detect. WindMouse solves this by:

- ✨ **Generating curved, natural-looking paths** instead of straight lines
- ⚡ **Varying movement speed** dynamically throughout the trajectory
- 🎯 **Supporting multiple backends**: AutoHotkey (Windows) and PyAutoGUI (cross-platform)
- 🧩 **Offering fine-grained control** over movement physics (gravity, wind, damping)

Perfect for web scraping, game automation, UI testing, or any scenario where you need to simulate realistic human interaction.

## Demo

![Demo Animation](demo.gif)

*Demonstration of the WindMouse algorithm in action.*

---

## Installation

### Standard Installation

```bash
pip install windmouse
```

### Modern Alternative (using `uv`)

```bash
uv add windmouse
```

### Optional Dependencies

WindMouse supports multiple backends. Choose the one that fits your needs:

**For PyAutoGUI (cross-platform):**
```bash
pip install windmouse[pyautogui]
# or with uv:
uv add "windmouse[pyautogui]"
```

**For AutoHotkey (Windows only):**
```bash
pip install windmouse[ahk]
# or with uv:
uv add "windmouse[ahk]"
```

**Install all backends:**
```bash
pip install windmouse[all]
# or with uv:
uv add "windmouse[all]"
```

> **Note for Windows + AHK users**: You must have [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed on your system to use the `ahk` backend.

---

## Quick Start

### Using PyAutoGUI (Cross-Platform)

```python
from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
from windmouse import Coordinate

# Initialize the controller
mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

# Set destination coordinates
mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

# Move the mouse using WindMouse algorithm
mouse.move_to_target(
    tick_delay=0.005,      # Small delay between steps
    step_duration=0.1      # Duration of each movement step
)
```

### Using AutoHotkey (Windows Only)

```python
from ahk import AHK
from windmouse.ahk_controller import AHKMouseController
from windmouse import Coordinate

# Initialize AHK and controller
ahk = AHK()
mouse = AHKMouseController(ahk)

# Set destination coordinates
mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

# Move the mouse using WindMouse algorithm
mouse.move_to_target(
    tick_delay=0.005,
    step_duration=0.1
)
```

### Advanced: Fine-Tuning the Algorithm

You can customize the physics of the mouse movement:

```python
from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
from windmouse import Coordinate

mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
    gravity_magnitude=9,    # Strength of attraction to target (default: 9)
    wind_magnitude=3,       # Randomness/curvature of path (default: 3)
    max_step=15,            # Maximum speed (default: 15)
    damped_distance=12      # Distance where movement starts to slow (default: 12)
)

mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(1000), Coordinate(500))
mouse.move_to_target()
```

### Drag and Drop

Hold a mouse button while moving (useful for drag-and-drop operations):

```python
from windmouse import HoldMouseButton

mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(500), Coordinate(300))
mouse.move_to_target(hold_button=HoldMouseButton.LEFT)
```

Algorithm Explained
===================

This page provides an in-depth explanation of the WindMouse algorithm, its physics principles, and the mathematics behind human-like mouse movement generation.

Overview
--------

The WindMouse algorithm generates realistic, non-linear mouse trajectories by simulating physical forces acting on the cursor. Unlike simple linear interpolation (which moves in a straight line at constant speed), WindMouse creates curved paths with variable speed—closely mimicking how humans naturally move a mouse.

The Problem with Traditional Mouse Movement
--------------------------------------------

Most automation tools use linear interpolation:

.. code-block:: python

   # Naive linear movement (easily detectable)
   for t in range(steps):
       x = start_x + (dest_x - start_x) * (t / steps)
       y = start_y + (dest_y - start_y) * (t / steps)
       move_mouse(x, y)

This approach has several problems:

* **Perfect straight lines**: Humans rarely move the mouse in perfectly straight lines
* **Constant speed**: Real human movement accelerates and decelerates
* **No variation**: Repeated movements follow identical paths
* **Easily detectable**: Bot detection systems can identify these patterns

The WindMouse Solution
-----------------------

WindMouse solves these problems by simulating a physics-based system with three key forces:

1. **Gravity**: Attracts the cursor toward the target (directed force)
2. **Wind**: Adds randomness and curvature to the path (random force)
3. **Velocity Damping**: Slows down as the cursor approaches the target

The algorithm operates in discrete time steps, updating velocity and position at each iteration.

Mathematical Model
------------------

Physics Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At each time step, the algorithm updates the cursor state based on forces:

**Position Update**:

.. math::

   x_{t+1} = x_t + v_x

   y_{t+1} = y_t + v_y

**Velocity Update**:

.. math::

   v_x = v_x + W_x + G_x

   v_y = v_y + W_y + G_y

Where:
- :math:`v_x, v_y` are velocity components
- :math:`W_x, W_y` are wind force components
- :math:`G_x, G_y` are gravity force components

Gravity Force
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gravity provides the directed force pulling the cursor toward the target:

.. math::

   G_x = g \\cdot \\frac{(dest_x - x)}{dist}

   G_y = g \\cdot \\frac{(dest_y - y)}{dist}

Where:
- :math:`g` is ``gravity_magnitude`` (default: 9)
- :math:`dist = \\sqrt{(dest_x - x)^2 + (dest_y - y)^2}` is the distance to target

This creates a force vector pointing directly at the target with magnitude proportional to ``gravity_magnitude``.

Wind Force
^^^^^^^^^^

Wind adds randomness and curvature. Its behavior changes based on distance from target:

**Far from target** (:math:`dist \\geq damped\\_distance`):

.. math::

   W_x = \\frac{W_x}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{(2r - 1) \\cdot w}{\\sqrt{5}}

   W_y = \\frac{W_y}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{(2r - 1) \\cdot w}{\\sqrt{5}}

**Close to target** (:math:`dist < damped\\_distance`):

.. math::

   W_x = \\frac{W_x}{\\sqrt{3}}

   W_y = \\frac{W_y}{\\sqrt{3}}

Where:
- :math:`r` is a random value in [0, 1]
- :math:`w = \\min(wind\\_magnitude, dist)` is the effective wind magnitude
- :math:`\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732` is the damping factor
- :math:`\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236` is the fluctuation factor

The wind force:
- Decays over time (divided by √3 each step)
- Adds random fluctuations when far from target
- Only decays (no new randomness) when close to target

Velocity Clamping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The velocity magnitude is clamped to prevent excessive speed:

.. math::

   |v| = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}

If :math:`|v| > max\\_step`:

.. math::

   clip = \\frac{max\\_step}{2} + r \\cdot \\frac{max\\_step}{2}

   v_x = \\frac{v_x}{|v|} \\cdot clip

   v_y = \\frac{v_y}{|v|} \\cdot clip

Where :math:`r` is random in [0, 1].

This ensures the cursor doesn't move too fast while adding slight speed variation.

Algorithm Pseudocode
--------------------

Here's the complete algorithm in pseudocode:

.. code-block:: text

   function WindMouse(start_x, start_y, dest_x, dest_y, gravity, wind, max_step, damped_dist):
       x, y = start_x, start_y
       vx, vy = 0, 0
       wx, wy = 0, 0

       while distance(x, y, dest_x, dest_y) >= 1:
           dist = distance(x, y, dest_x, dest_y)
           wind_current = min(wind, dist)

           # Update wind
           if dist >= damped_dist:
               wx = wx/sqrt(3) + (2*random() - 1) * wind_current/sqrt(5)
               wy = wy/sqrt(3) + (2*random() - 1) * wind_current/sqrt(5)
           else:
               wx = wx/sqrt(3)
               wy = wy/sqrt(3)
               if max_step < 3:
                   max_step = random() * 3 + 3
               else:
                   max_step = max_step/sqrt(5)

Parameter Effects
-----------------

Understanding how each parameter affects the generated path:

gravity_magnitude
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Effect**: Controls the strength of attraction to the target.

* **Low (3-6)**: Weak attraction
   - Path wanders more
   - Takes longer to reach target
   - More influenced by wind
   - Very curved trajectories

* **Medium (7-10)**: Balanced (Default: 9)
   - Natural-looking curves
   - Reasonable convergence time
   - Good balance of control and randomness

* **High (11-15)**: Strong attraction
   - More direct paths
   - Faster convergence
   - Less curve, more purposeful
   - Dominates wind effect

**Visual Effect**:

.. code-block:: text

   Low gravity (5):     Medium gravity (9):    High gravity (13):
        *----->              *---->                  *--->
       /       \\            /     \\                 |    \\
      /         \\          /       \\                |     \\
     o           T         o         T               o      T
   (very curved)        (natural)              (fairly direct)

wind_magnitude
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Effect**: Controls the amount of random curvature and unpredictability.

* **Low (0-2)**: Minimal wind
   - Nearly straight paths
   - Predictable movement
   - Less human-like
   - Good for speed-priority scenarios

* **Medium (3-5)**: Moderate wind (Default: 3)
   - Natural curves
   - Good human-like appearance
   - Balanced unpredictability

* **High (6-10)**: Strong wind
   - Very curved paths
   - Highly unpredictable
   - May look drunk/erratic
   - Good for testing detection systems

**Visual Effect**:

.. code-block:: text

   Low wind (1):        Medium wind (3):       High wind (8):
        *-->                 *~>                    *~~>
        |  \\                /  \\                  / |\\
        |   \\              /    \\                /  | \\
        o    T             o      T              o   |  T
   (nearly straight)     (gentle curve)      (chaotic path)

max_step
^^^^^^^^

**Effect**: Controls the maximum speed (pixels per step).

* **Low (5-10)**: Slow movement
   - Takes longer to reach target
   - More controlled, deliberate
   - Good for precision tasks

* **Medium (12-18)**: Normal speed (Default: 15)
   - Balanced speed and control
   - Natural-looking pace

* **High (20-30)**: Fast movement
   - Quick traversal
   - May look less natural at very high values
   - Good for efficiency-priority scenarios

**Note**: The actual movement speed also depends on ``tick_delay`` and ``step_duration`` in ``move_to_target()``.

damped_distance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Effect**: Distance from target (in pixels) where behavior changes.

* **Low (5-10)**: Late damping
   - Maintains speed and wind longer
   - Sharper approach to target
   - Less cautious

* **Medium (12-15)**: Balanced (Default: 12)
   - Natural slowdown
   - Smooth approach
   - Human-like deceleration

* **High (20-30)**: Early damping
   - Slows down far from target
   - Very cautious approach
   - May look hesitant

**Visual Effect**:

.. code-block:: text

   Low damped_dist (8):       Medium (12):         High (25):
        *=======>                  *=====>              *==>
        |||||||||                  ||||-->              ||---->
   -----o-------T            -----o-------T       -----o-------T
   (fast until close)       (gradual slow)      (early slowdown)

Why These Specific Constants?
------------------------------

You might wonder why the algorithm uses :math:`\\sqrt{3}` and :math:`\\sqrt{5}`:

**√3 ≈ 1.732** (Wind Damping)
   - Provides gradual decay of wind force
   - Balances persistence and decay
   - Empirically found to produce natural-looking curves
   - Fast enough to converge, slow enough to maintain influence

**√5 ≈ 2.236** (Wind Fluctuation & Velocity Reduction)
   - Scales random fluctuations appropriately
   - Prevents wind from overwhelming gravity
   - Creates smooth randomness rather than jitter
   - Also used for max_step reduction near target

These constants were likely chosen through experimentation to balance:
- Convergence speed
- Path naturalness
- Computational stability
- Aesthetic appeal

Algorithm Characteristics
-------------------------

Convergence Guarantee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The algorithm is **guaranteed to converge** to the target because:

1. Gravity always points toward target and doesn't decay
2. Wind decays over time (divided by √3 each step)
3. As distance decreases, wind becomes less effective
4. Close to target, only gravity remains (no new wind)

The stopping condition is ``distance < 1 pixel``, which is always eventually satisfied.

Non-Determinism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The algorithm is **non-deterministic** due to random wind fluctuations. Running it multiple times with the same parameters produces different paths.

This is a **feature**, not a bug:
- Prevents pattern recognition
- Mimics human inconsistency
- Makes bot detection harder

Scale Independence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The algorithm works well across different screen resolutions and distances because:

- Parameters are pixel-based (scale-agnostic)
- Wind magnitude adapts to distance (``min(wind_magnitude, dist)``)
- Gravity is normalized by distance (``/ dist``)

However, you may want to tune parameters for very large distances (e.g., 4K displays) or very short distances (small UI elements).

Comparison to Other Algorithms
-------------------------------

Linear Interpolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   # Linear
   x = start_x + (dest_x - start_x) * t

**WindMouse advantages**:
- ✅ Non-linear paths
- ✅ Variable speed
- ✅ Unpredictable
- ❌ More computationally expensive

Bézier Curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bézier curves can create smooth paths but:

- ❌ Require predetermined control points
- ❌ Path is deterministic given control points
- ❌ No physical simulation
- ❌ Speed is uniform (unless manually varied)

**WindMouse advantages**:
- ✅ Physics-based (more natural)
- ✅ Emergent behavior
- ✅ No need to specify control points

Simplex/Perlin Noise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Noise functions can add randomness but:

- ❌ Don't inherently move toward target
- ❌ Require combining with directed movement
- ❌ May produce unnatural patterns

**WindMouse advantages**:
- ✅ Built-in target seeking
- ✅ Balanced randomness and purpose
- ✅ Complete solution in one algorithm

Implementation Details
-----------------------

Generator-Based Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``wind_mouse()`` function is a **generator**, yielding coordinates one at a time:

.. code-block:: python

   def wind_mouse(...) -> Generator[tuple[Coordinate, Coordinate], None, None]:
       # ...
       yield Coordinate(move_x), Coordinate(move_y)

**Benefits**:

- Memory efficient (doesn't store entire path)
- Allows real-time movement
- Can be interrupted mid-path
- Enables custom tick-based control

Coordinate Type Safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WindMouse uses ``NewType`` for coordinates:

.. code-block:: python

   Coordinate = NewType("Coordinate", int)

This provides type safety without runtime overhead, helping catch errors at type-check time.

Optimization Opportunities
--------------------------

For performance-critical applications, consider:

1. **Pre-compute sqrt(3) and sqrt(5)**: Already done in the library
2. **Use NumPy vectorization**: Already used for ``np.hypot()``
3. **Reduce tick_delay**: Set to 0 for maximum speed
4. **Reduce step_duration**: Use smaller values (0.01-0.05)
5. **Increase max_step**: Higher values = fewer total steps

Example optimized configuration:

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       max_step=20,  # Increase speed
       gravity_magnitude=12,  # More direct
   )

   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
   mouse.move_to_target(
       tick_delay=0,  # No delay
       step_duration=0.01  # Fast transitions
   )

Visualizing the Algorithm
--------------------------

To better understand the algorithm, you can visualize the path:

.. code-block:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from windmouse.core import wind_mouse, Coordinate

   # Generate path
   path = list(wind_mouse(
       Coordinate(0), Coordinate(0),
       Coordinate(500), Coordinate(500),
       gravity_magnitude=9,
       wind_magnitude=3,
       max_step=15,
       damped_distance=12
   ))

   # Extract x and y coordinates
   xs, ys = zip(*path)

   # Plot
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
   plt.plot(xs, ys, 'b-', linewidth=1, alpha=0.7)
   plt.plot(xs[0], ys[0], 'go', markersize=10, label='Start')
   plt.plot(xs[-1], ys[-1], 'ro', markersize=10, label='End')
   plt.legend()
   plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
   plt.axis('equal')
   plt.title('WindMouse Path Visualization')
   plt.show()

Getting Started
---------------

Development Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Fork and Clone**

   Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/YOUR_AsfhtgkDavid/windmouse.git
      cd windmouse

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using pip:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .[all,dev,docs]

   Or using uv (recommended):

   .. code-block:: bash

      uv sync --all-groups

3. **Verify Installation**

   Run a quick test to ensure everything is working:

   .. code-block:: python

      python -c "from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController; print('Success!')"

Code Style
----------

WindMouse follows strict code quality standards to maintain consistency and readability.

Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^

We use **Black** for code formatting with a line length of 79 characters:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Format your code before committing
   black src/

Black configuration is in ``pyproject.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.black]
   line-length = 79

Type Checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use **mypy** with strict mode enabled. All code must pass type checking:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run type checker
   mypy src/

Mypy configuration is in ``pyproject.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [tool.mypy]
   strict = true

Key type checking requirements:

* All function parameters must have type hints
* All return types must be annotated
* No ``Any`` types without explicit justification
* Use ``Optional[T]`` for nullable values
* Use ``NewType`` for semantic type safety (like ``Coordinate``)

Code Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow these guidelines when writing code:

1. **Docstrings**: Use Google or NumPy style docstrings for all public APIs:

   .. code-block:: python

      def example_function(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
          """
          Brief description of the function.

          Args:
              param1: Description of param1.
              param2: Description of param2.

          Returns:
              Description of return value.

          Raises:
              ValueError: When invalid input is provided.
          """
          pass

2. **Import Order**: Follow standard Python import conventions:

   .. code-block:: python

      # Standard library
      import enum
      import time
      from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

      # Third-party
      import numpy as np

      # Local
      from .core import Coordinate

3. **Naming Conventions**:

   * Classes: ``PascalCase`` (e.g., ``PyautoguiMouseController``)
   * Functions/methods: ``snake_case`` (e.g., ``move_to_target``)
   * Constants: ``UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`` (e.g., ``GRAVITY_MAGNITUDE_DEFAULT``)
   * Private methods: ``_leading_underscore`` (e.g., ``_get_next_point``)

4. **Abstract Methods**: Use ``@abstractmethod`` decorator for interface definitions

5. **Type Safety**: Prefer ``NewType`` for semantic clarity (like ``Coordinate``)

Making Changes
--------------

Branch Naming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

* ``feature/`` - New features (e.g., ``feature/add-bezier-mode``)
* ``fix/`` - Bug fixes (e.g., ``fix/velocity-clamp-issue``)
* ``docs/`` - Documentation (e.g., ``docs/improve-api-reference``)
* ``refactor/`` - Code refactoring (e.g., ``refactor/simplify-tick-logic``)
* ``test/`` - Test additions/improvements (e.g., ``test/add-ahk-tests``)

Commit Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write clear, descriptive commit messages using conventional commits format:

.. code-block:: text

   <type>: <short description>

   <optional longer description>

   <optional footer>

Types:

* ``feat``: New feature
* ``fix``: Bug fix
* ``docs``: Documentation changes
* ``style``: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
* ``refactor``: Code restructuring without behavior change
* ``test``: Adding or updating tests
* ``chore``: Maintenance tasks

Examples:

.. code-block:: text

   feat: Add support for circular mouse paths

   Implements a new CircularPathController that moves the mouse
   in circular trajectories instead of WindMouse paths.

.. code-block:: text

   fix: Correct velocity clamping calculation

   The max_step parameter was not being applied correctly in
   close-range scenarios. This fixes the clamping logic.

.. code-block:: text

   docs: Add troubleshooting section for Linux permissions

Testing
-------

Running Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all tests pass:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run with coverage
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

   # Run specific test file
   pytest tests/test_core.py

Writing Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When adding new features, include appropriate tests:

.. code-block:: python

   import pytest
   from windmouse.core import wind_mouse, Coordinate


   def test_wind_mouse_convergence():
       """Test that wind_mouse reaches the target."""
       start_x, start_y = Coordinate(0), Coordinate(0)
       dest_x, dest_y = Coordinate(100), Coordinate(100)

       path = list(wind_mouse(start_x, start_y, dest_x, dest_y))

       # Check that we have a path
       assert len(path) > 0

       # Check that final position is close to target
       final_x, final_y = path[-1]
       assert abs(final_x - dest_x) <= 1
       assert abs(final_y - dest_y) <= 1

Test guidelines:

* Test both success and failure cases
* Use descriptive test names
* Include docstrings explaining what the test verifies
* Mock external dependencies (like ``pyautogui`` or ``ahk``)
* Aim for high code coverage (target: >80%)

Documentation
-------------

Building Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build the documentation locally to preview changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd docs
   make html

   # View in browser
   open _build/html/index.html  # macOS
   xdg-open _build/html/index.html  # Linux
   start _build/html/index.html  # Windows

Or use Sphinx directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html

Documentation Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When updating documentation:

1. **Use reStructuredText (.rst) format** for all documentation files
2. **Include code examples** that are tested and working
3. **Cross-reference** related sections using ``:doc:`` directives
4. **Update API documentation** if you change function signatures
5. **Add new pages** to the ``toctree`` in ``index.rst``

Example of good documentation:

.. code-block:: rst

   test_configs = [
       {"gravity_magnitude": 5, "wind_magnitude": 8},
       {"gravity_magnitude": 12, "wind_magnitude": 1},
       {"max_step": 5, "damped_distance": 30},
   ]

   for config in test_configs:
       mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(**config)
       mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(500), Coordinate(500))
       mouse.move_to_target()

Examples
========

This page provides practical code examples for common WindMouse usage patterns.

Basic Movement
--------------

PyAutoGUI (Cross-Platform)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Create controller with default parameters
   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Move to target
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
   mouse.move_to_target()

AutoHotkey (Windows)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from ahk import AHK
   from windmouse.ahk_controller import AHKMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Initialize AHK
   ahk = AHK()

   # Create controller
   mouse = AHKMouseController(ahk)

   # Move to target
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(1920), Coordinate(1080))
   mouse.move_to_target()

Custom Physics Parameters
--------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Customize physics parameters
   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       gravity_magnitude=9,    # Attraction strength
       wind_magnitude=3,       # Curvature amount
       max_step=15,            # Maximum speed
       damped_distance=12      # Slowdown distance
   )

   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
   mouse.move_to_target()

Changing Destination On-The-Fly
--------------------------------

You can dynamically change the destination **during movement** by setting a new target between ticks.
When you change ``dest_position``, the algorithm recalculates the path and smoothly redirects to the new target.

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Start with initial target
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

   step_count = 0
   while mouse.tick(step_duration=0.1):
       step_count += 1
       time.sleep(0.01)

       # Change destination after 10 steps
       if step_count == 10:
           print("Redirecting to new target!")
           mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(400), Coordinate(300))

       # Or change based on external condition
       # if target_moved:
       #     mouse.dest_position = get_new_target_position()

       # Can stop early if needed
       if should_abort:
           break

   print(f"Movement completed in {step_count} steps")

**Note:** Setting a new ``dest_position`` regenerates the internal path generator,
so the mouse will smoothly transition to the new target from its current position.

This technique is useful for:

* **Reactive movements** - responding to changing targets
* **Following moving objects** - tracking dynamic positions
* **Adaptive behavior** - adjusting path based on conditions
* **Emergency stops** - breaking out of movement early

Drag and Drop
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate, HoldMouseButton

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Move to source position
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(300), Coordinate(300))
   mouse.move_to_target()

   # Drag to destination with left button held
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(700), Coordinate(500))
   mouse.move_to_target(hold_button=HoldMouseButton.LEFT)

Sequential Movements
--------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Define waypoints
   waypoints = [
       (Coordinate(200), Coordinate(200)),
       (Coordinate(600), Coordinate(200)),
       (Coordinate(600), Coordinate(600)),
       (Coordinate(200), Coordinate(600)),
   ]

   # Move through each waypoint
   for dest in waypoints:
       mouse.dest_position = dest
       mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0.005)
       time.sleep(0.3)  # Pause at each waypoint

^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       max_step=8,             # Lower speed
       damped_distance=25      # Early slowdown
   )

   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
   mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0.01, step_duration=0.2)

-------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

   # Manual control loop
   while mouse.tick(step_duration=0.1):
       time.sleep(0.01)

       # Perform custom logic between steps
       current_pos = pyautogui.position()
       print(f"Current position: {current_pos}")

       # Can break early based on conditions
       if some_condition:
           break

WindMouse Documentation
=======================

**WindMouse** is a Python library that generates human-like mouse movements to avoid bot detection in automation scripts. It implements the WindMouse algorithm, which creates realistic, non-linear trajectories with variable speed—mimicking natural human mouse behavior.

Why WindMouse?
--------------

Traditional automation tools move the mouse in straight lines at constant speeds, making them easy to detect. WindMouse solves this by:

* ✨ **Generating curved, natural-looking paths** instead of straight lines
* ⚡ **Varying movement speed** dynamically throughout the trajectory
* 🎯 **Supporting multiple backends**: AutoHotkey (Windows) and PyAutoGUI (cross-platform)
* 🧩 **Offering fine-grained control** over movement physics (gravity, wind, damping)

Perfect for web scraping, game automation, UI testing, or any scenario where you need to simulate realistic human interaction.

Key Features
------------

* **Human-like Movement**: Creates non-linear, curved trajectories that mimic natural mouse behavior
* **Physics-based Algorithm**: Uses gravity, wind, and damping parameters to simulate realistic motion
* **Multi-backend Support**: Works with PyAutoGUI (cross-platform) or AutoHotkey (Windows)
* **Drag & Drop Support**: Hold mouse buttons during movement for drag operations
* **Fine-grained Control**: Adjust movement speed, curvature, and physics parameters
* **Type-safe**: Fully typed with mypy support

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Initialize the controller
   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Set destination and move
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
   mouse.move_to_target()

Installation
============

This guide covers the installation process for WindMouse and its optional dependencies.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.10 or higher
* NumPy 1.20 or higher (automatically installed)

Operating System Support:

* **PyAutoGUI backend**: Windows, macOS, Linux
* **AutoHotkey backend**: Windows only

Standard Installation
---------------------

The basic installation includes the core WindMouse algorithm and NumPy dependency:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install windmouse

This installs the core library without any controller backends.

Modern Alternative (uv)
-----------------------

`uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`_ is a modern, fast Python package installer:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv add windmouse

Installing Backend Dependencies
--------------------------------

WindMouse supports multiple backends for controlling the mouse. Choose the one that fits your needs.

PyAutoGUI Backend (Recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyAutoGUI is a cross-platform library that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install windmouse[pyautogui]

Or with uv:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv add "windmouse[pyautogui]"

**Additional PyAutoGUI Requirements:**

On **Linux**, you may need to install additional dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev

   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install python3-tkinter python3-devel

   # Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S tk

On **macOS**, PyAutoGUI should work out of the box on most systems.

AutoHotkey Backend (Windows Only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AutoHotkey provides native Windows integration and potentially smoother mouse movements:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install windmouse[ahk]

Or with uv:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv add "windmouse[ahk]"

**Important**: You must have `AutoHotkey <https://www.autohotkey.com/>`_ installed on your system:

1. Download AutoHotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Install it (the default installation is sufficient)
3. Ensure it's accessible from your system PATH

Install All Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install both backends at once:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install windmouse[all]

Or with uv:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv add "windmouse[all]"

Development Installation
------------------------

If you want to contribute to WindMouse or run the examples, clone the repository and install in development mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/windmouse.git
   cd windmouse
   pip install -e .[all,dev]

Or with uv:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/windmouse.git
   cd windmouse
   uv sync --all-groups

Verifying Installation
----------------------

After installation, verify that WindMouse is working:

.. code-block:: python

   # Test with PyAutoGUI
   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()
   print("PyAutoGUI backend loaded successfully!")

For AutoHotkey (Windows only):

.. code-block:: python

   # Test with AHK
   from ahk import AHK
   from windmouse.ahk_controller import AHKMouseController

   ahk = AHK()
   mouse = AHKMouseController(ahk)
   print("AHK backend loaded successfully!")

Troubleshooting
---------------

Import Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Problem**: ``ImportError: You need install windmouse[pyautogui]``

**Solution**: Install the appropriate backend extras:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install windmouse[pyautogui]

**Problem**: ``OSError: Ahk available only for Windows``

**Solution**: The AutoHotkey backend only works on Windows. Use PyAutoGUI on other platforms.

Permission Errors (Linux)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Problem**: Mouse doesn't move or permission denied errors on Linux.

**Solution**: On some Linux systems, you may need to run your script with appropriate permissions or configure X11 access:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Option 1: Run with sudo (not recommended for production)
   sudo python your_script.py

   # Option 2: Configure X11 to allow connections (better approach)
   xhost +local:

   # Option 3: Use accessibility features (distro-specific)
   # Check your distribution's documentation for enabling accessibility

PyAutoGUI Issues on macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Problem**: PyAutoGUI not working on macOS.

**Solution**: You may need to grant accessibility permissions:

1. Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
2. Add your terminal application or Python interpreter to the list
3. Check the box to grant permission
4. Restart your terminal/IDE

AutoHotkey Not Found (Windows)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Problem**: ``AutoHotkey is not installed or not in PATH``

**Solution**:

1. Download and install AutoHotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Ensure the installation directory is in your system PATH
3. Restart your terminal/IDE after installation
4. Verify by running ``ahk`` in Command Prompt

Virtual Display (Headless Servers)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Problem**: Need to run WindMouse on a headless server (no display).

**Solution**: Use a virtual display driver like Xvfb on Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install Xvfb
   sudo apt-get install xvfb

   # Run your script with virtual display
   xvfb-run python your_script.py

For Windows servers, consider using virtual desktop tools or remote desktop services.

NumPy Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Problem**: NumPy version conflicts or import errors.

**Solution**: WindMouse requires NumPy >= 1.20. Update NumPy:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade numpy

Type Checking Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Problem**: mypy reports errors in WindMouse code.

**Solution**: Install type stubs for dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install types-pyautogui

   mouse.dest_position = (
       Coordinate(base_x + random.randint(-offset, offset)),
       Coordinate(base_y + random.randint(-offset, offset))
   )
   mouse.move_to_target()

HoldMouseButton Values
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse import HoldMouseButton

   HoldMouseButton.NONE    # No button (default)
   HoldMouseButton.LEFT    # Left mouse button
   HoldMouseButton.RIGHT   # Right mouse button
   HoldMouseButton.MIDDLE  # Middle mouse button

Default Constants
-----------------

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.core import (
       GRAVITY_MAGNITUDE_DEFAULT,  # 9
       WIND_MAGNITUDE_DEFAULT,     # 3
       MAX_STEP_DEFAULT,           # 15
       DAMPED_DISTANCE_DEFAULT     # 12
   )

Error Handling
--------------

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
       mouse.move_to_target()

Best Practices
=================

Type Safety
-----------

Always use ``Coordinate`` type for coordinates to ensure type safety:

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Good ✓
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

   # Avoid - may work but not type-safe
   # mouse.dest_position = (800, 600)

Error Handling
--------------

Handle exceptions gracefully:

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   try:
       mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()
       mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
       mouse.move_to_target()
   except ValueError as e:
       print(f"Configuration error: {e}")
   except ImportError as e:
       print(f"Missing dependency: {e}")
   except OSError as e:
       print(f"Platform error: {e}")

Resource Management
-------------------

For AHK backend, reuse the AHK instance across multiple controllers to avoid resource overhead:

.. code-block:: python

   from ahk import AHK
   from windmouse.ahk_controller import AHKMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Good ✓ - Create once, reuse multiple times
   ahk = AHK()
   mouse1 = AHKMouseController(ahk)
   mouse2 = AHKMouseController(ahk)

   # Avoid - Creates new AHK instance each time
   # mouse1 = AHKMouseController(AHK())
   # mouse2 = AHKMouseController(AHK())

Controller Reuse
----------------

Reuse controller instances for multiple movements:

.. code-block:: python

   # Good ✓ - Reuse controller
   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()
   for target in targets:
       mouse.dest_position = target
       mouse.move_to_target()

   # Avoid - Creates unnecessary instances
   # for target in targets:
   #     mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()
   #     mouse.dest_position = target
   #     mouse.move_to_target()

Adding Natural Variation
-------------------------

Use random offsets and parameter variations to make movements less predictable:

.. code-block:: python

   import random
   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Vary physics parameters
   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       gravity_magnitude=random.randint(8, 12),
       wind_magnitude=random.randint(2, 5),
       max_step=random.randint(12, 18)
   )

   # Add random offset to target
   target_x = Coordinate(800 + random.randint(-10, 10))
   target_y = Coordinate(600 + random.randint(-10, 10))
   mouse.dest_position = (target_x, target_y)
   mouse.move_to_target()


```

Usage Guide
===========

This guide provides comprehensive examples and explanations for using WindMouse in your projects.

Basic Usage
-----------

PyAutoGUI Backend (Cross-Platform)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PyAutoGUI backend is the recommended choice for cross-platform projects:

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Create a controller instance
   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Set the destination coordinates
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

   # Move to the target with default settings
   mouse.move_to_target()

AutoHotkey Backend (Windows)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Windows-specific projects, the AHK backend may provide smoother movements:

.. code-block:: python

   from ahk import AHK
   from windmouse.ahk_controller import AHKMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate

   # Initialize AHK
   ahk = AHK()

   # Create a controller instance with AHK
   mouse = AHKMouseController(ahk)

   # Set destination and move
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(1920), Coordinate(1080))
   mouse.move_to_target()

Understanding Movement Parameters
----------------------------------

The ``move_to_target()`` method accepts several parameters that control the movement behavior:

tick_delay
^^^^^^^^^^

**Type**: ``float`` (default: ``0``)

**Description**: Sleep time in seconds between each movement step. Higher values slow down the overall movement.

**Use Cases**:

* **0** (default): Maximum speed, no delay
* **0.001-0.01**: Natural speed for most applications
* **0.05-0.1**: Slower, more deliberate movements

**Example**:

.. code-block:: python

   # Fast movement (no delay)
   mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0)

   # Natural speed
   mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0.005)

   # Slow, deliberate movement
   mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0.1)

step_duration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Type**: ``float`` (default: ``0.1``)

**Description**: Duration in seconds for each individual movement step. This affects the smoothness and speed of the transition between points.

* **Lower values** (0.01-0.05): Faster, more abrupt movements
* **Medium values** (0.1-0.2): Natural, smooth movements
* **Higher values** (0.5-1.0): Very slow, exaggerated movements

**Example**:

.. code-block:: python

   # Quick, snappy movement
   mouse.move_to_target(step_duration=0.05)

   # Smooth, natural movement (default)
   mouse.move_to_target(step_duration=0.1)

   # Slow, deliberate movement
   mouse.move_to_target(step_duration=0.5)

hold_button
^^^^^^^^^^^

**Type**: ``HoldMouseButton`` (default: ``HoldMouseButton.NONE``)

**Description**: Specifies which mouse button to hold down during movement, enabling drag-and-drop operations.

**Available Options**:

* ``HoldMouseButton.NONE``: No button held (default)
* ``HoldMouseButton.LEFT``: Hold left mouse button
* ``HoldMouseButton.RIGHT``: Hold right mouse button
* ``HoldMouseButton.MIDDLE``: Hold middle mouse button

**Example**:

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse import HoldMouseButton

   # Drag with left mouse button
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(500), Coordinate(300))
   mouse.move_to_target(hold_button=HoldMouseButton.LEFT)

   # Right-click drag
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(700), Coordinate(400))
   mouse.move_to_target(hold_button=HoldMouseButton.RIGHT)

Fine-Tuning the Physics
------------------------

The WindMouse algorithm simulates physical forces to create realistic movement. You can customize these parameters when creating the controller.

Understanding the Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**gravity_magnitude** (default: ``9``)
   Strength of the attractive force pulling the cursor toward the target.

   * **Higher values** (12-15): More direct paths, faster convergence
   * **Lower values** (5-7): More curved, wandering paths

**wind_magnitude** (default: ``3``)
   Amount of random "wind" force creating curvature and unpredictability.

   * **Higher values** (5-10): More curved, chaotic paths
   * **Lower values** (1-2): Straighter, more predictable paths

**max_step** (default: ``15``)
   Maximum velocity/speed of the cursor (measured in pixels per step).

   * **Higher values** (20-30): Faster overall movement
   * **Lower values** (5-10): Slower, more controlled movement

**damped_distance** (default: ``12``)
   Distance from target (in pixels) where the movement begins to slow down and wind effects decrease.

   * **Higher values** (20-30): Slows down earlier, more cautious approach
   * **Lower values** (5-10): Maintains speed closer to target

Customization Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Aggressive, Fast Movement**:

.. code-block:: python

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       gravity_magnitude=15,  # Strong pull toward target
       wind_magnitude=1,      # Minimal curvature
       max_step=25,           # High speed
       damped_distance=8      # Late slowdown
   )

**Natural, Human-like Movement** (Default):

.. code-block:: python

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       gravity_magnitude=9,
       wind_magnitude=3,
       max_step=15,
       damped_distance=12
   )

**Cautious, Curved Movement**:

.. code-block:: python

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       gravity_magnitude=6,   # Weaker attraction
       wind_magnitude=7,      # High curvature
       max_step=10,           # Lower speed
       damped_distance=25     # Early slowdown
   )

**Drunk/Chaotic Movement** (for testing detection):

.. code-block:: python

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
       gravity_magnitude=5,
       wind_magnitude=10,
       max_step=8,
       damped_distance=30
   )

Advanced Usage Patterns
------------------------

Setting Start and Destination Separately
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set start and destination coordinates independently:

.. code-block:: python

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Set start position explicitly
   mouse.start_position = (Coordinate(100), Coordinate(100))

   # Set destination
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(500), Coordinate(500))

   # Or set coordinates individually
   mouse.dest_x = Coordinate(800)
   mouse.dest_y = Coordinate(600)

   mouse.move_to_target()

If you don't set ``start_position``, the controller automatically uses the current mouse position.

Multiple Sequential Movements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chain multiple movements together for complex patterns:

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate
   import time

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Define a series of waypoints
   waypoints = [
       (Coordinate(200), Coordinate(200)),
       (Coordinate(600), Coordinate(200)),
       (Coordinate(600), Coordinate(600)),
       (Coordinate(200), Coordinate(600)),
       (Coordinate(400), Coordinate(400)),  # Return to center
   ]

   # Move through each waypoint
   for dest in waypoints:
       mouse.dest_position = dest
       mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0.005)
       time.sleep(0.5)  # Pause at each waypoint

Manual Tick-Based Movement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For advanced control, you can manually call ``tick()`` instead of ``move_to_target()``:

.. code-block:: python

   import time

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

   # Manual control loop
   while mouse.tick(step_duration=0.1):
       # Do something between each step
       time.sleep(0.01)

       # You could check conditions and break early
       if some_condition:
           break

This is useful when you need to:

* Check conditions during movement
* Synchronize with other operations
* Implement custom stopping logic

Drag and Drop Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete drag-and-drop example:

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate, HoldMouseButton
   import time

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController()

   # Move to the item to drag
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(300), Coordinate(300))
   mouse.move_to_target()
   time.sleep(0.2)  # Brief pause

   # Drag to destination
   mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(700), Coordinate(500))
   mouse.move_to_target(hold_button=HoldMouseButton.LEFT)
   time.sleep(0.1)  # Brief pause after drop

Context Manager Pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While not built-in, you can create a context manager for cleanup:

.. code-block:: python

   from contextlib import contextmanager
   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController

   @contextmanager
   def windmouse_controller(**kwargs):
       """Context manager for WindMouse controller."""
       controller = PyautoguiMouseController(**kwargs)
       try:
           yield controller
       finally:
           # Cleanup if needed
           pass

   # Usage
   with windmouse_controller(gravity_magnitude=10) as mouse:
       mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
       mouse.move_to_target()

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

Movement Speed vs. Realism
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There's a trade-off between speed and realism:

* **Fast movements**: Low ``tick_delay`` (0-0.001), low ``step_duration`` (0.01-0.05)
* **Realistic movements**: Medium ``tick_delay`` (0.005-0.01), medium ``step_duration`` (0.1-0.2)
* **Exaggerated realism**: Higher values, more pronounced curves (``wind_magnitude`` 5-10)

Backend Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **PyAutoGUI**: Slight overhead from Python → OS calls, but very portable
* **AutoHotkey**: Native Windows integration, potentially smoother on Windows systems

For maximum performance:

.. code-block:: python

   # Minimal delay configuration
   mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0, step_duration=0.01)

Screen Resolution Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The WindMouse algorithm scales well across resolutions, but you may want to adjust parameters for different screen sizes:

.. code-block:: python

   import pyautogui

   # Get screen dimensions
   screen_width, screen_height = pyautogui.size()

   # Adjust max_step based on screen size
   max_step_adjusted = int(screen_width / 100)  # ~19 for 1920px width

   mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(max_step=max_step_adjusted)

Best Practices
--------------

1. **Always use Coordinate type**:

   .. code-block:: python

      # Good
      mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))

      # Avoid (type checker will complain)
      mouse.dest_position = (800, 600)

2. **Add small delays between operations**:

   .. code-block:: python

      import time

      mouse.move_to_target()
      time.sleep(0.1)  # Brief pause before next action
      # Click or other operation

3. **Test parameter combinations**:

   Different applications may be more or less sensitive to mouse patterns. Experiment with physics parameters to find what works best.

4. **Handle exceptions**:

   .. code-block:: python

      try:
          mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(800), Coordinate(600))
          mouse.move_to_target()
      except ValueError as e:
          print(f"Invalid coordinates: {e}")
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")

5. **Consider adding random variations**:

   .. code-block:: python

      import random

      # Add slight randomness to destination
      base_x, base_y = 800, 600
      offset = 5
      dest_x = Coordinate(base_x + random.randint(-offset, offset))
      dest_y = Coordinate(base_y + random.randint(-offset, offset))

      mouse.dest_position = (dest_x, dest_y)
      mouse.move_to_target()

Common Patterns
---------------

Web Scraping
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate
   import time
   import random

   def click_element(x: int, y: int):
       """Click an element with natural mouse movement."""
       mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
           gravity_magnitude=9,
           wind_magnitude=3,
           max_step=12
       )

       # Add slight randomness
       offset = 3
       dest_x = Coordinate(x + random.randint(-offset, offset))
       dest_y = Coordinate(y + random.randint(-offset, offset))

       mouse.dest_position = (dest_x, dest_y)
       mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0.003)

       # Small pause before clicking
       time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.3))

       # Perform click
       import pyautogui
       pyautogui.click()

Game Automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from windmouse.pyautogui_controller import PyautoguiMouseController
   from windmouse import Coordinate
   import time

   class GameBot:
       def __init__(self):
           self.mouse = PyautoguiMouseController(
               gravity_magnitude=12,  # Faster response
               wind_magnitude=2,      # Less curvature
               max_step=20            # Higher speed
           )

       def target_enemy(self, x: int, y: int):
           """Target and click enemy."""
           self.mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(x), Coordinate(y))
           self.mouse.move_to_target(
               tick_delay=0,
               step_duration=0.05
           )
           time.sleep(0.05)
           # Perform attack

       def patrol(self, points: list[tuple[int, int]]):
           """Move through patrol points."""
           for x, y in points:
               self.mouse.dest_position = (Coordinate(x), Coordinate(y))
               self.mouse.move_to_target(tick_delay=0.002)
               time.sleep(1.0)  # Wait at each point
