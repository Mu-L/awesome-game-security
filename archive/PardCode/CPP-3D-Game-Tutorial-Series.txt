## C++ 3D Game Tutorial Series
`C++ 3D Game Tutorial Series` is a tutorial series designed to help developers of all levels—from novice to expert—take their first steps into game development from scratch using C++.
This series will teach you how to create a 3D game sample, 
starting with creating a window using the Win32 API and progressing to building a game engine that enables the development of a functional 3D game. 
Specifically, the series covers the development of:
* DX3D Game Engine (composed by the following sub-systems)
  * DirectX 11 3D Graphics Engine
  * Win32 Windowing System
  * Input System
  * Entity-Component System
* Game Sample

The aim of this series is to provide developers with the foundational knowledge needed to have full control over game development, 
starting from low-level systems (such as the Graphics Engine, Input Manager, Entity System etc.) 
all the way to high-level concepts (e.g. Entities).

This repository contains:
* The `master` branch, which contains the source code of the entire project developed in the tutorial series.
* The `DX3D` folder, which contains both the public API and the source code of the DX3D engine, that will be implemented and used to create the game sample.
* The `Game` folder, which contains the source code of the game sample itself.

It is possible to access the source code of each tutorial by checking the [`Tags`](https://github.com/PardCode/CPP-3D-Game-Tutorial-Series/tags) list.

Additionally, the repository includes branches such as `AssetsAndLibs`, which are related to the previous version of the C++ 3D Game Tutorial Series.

The license of this repository is available [here](#license).


## Quick Guide to build the 3D Game Sample

### Prerequisites:
* Visual Studio 2022.
* Windows 10 or later.

Open `DirectXGame.sln` project, available under the project root folder.<br>
In Visual Studio, press the `Local Windows Debugger` button available in the toolbar.
