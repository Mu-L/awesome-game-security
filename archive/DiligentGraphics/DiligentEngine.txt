# Building Documentation

To build the documentation, install [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl).
Check the required version in the [GitHub Action file](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/github-action/blob/master/install-doxygen/action.yml).

Then, from the **root** of the repository, run the following commands:

**1. Generate the Markdown pages list**

By default, Doxygen lists all Markdown files in a flat, arbitrary order, which can look messy and isn't
very user-friendly. Use the script below to organize the Markdown files into a tree structure and generate
the `Doc/pages.dox` file:

```bash
python Doc/md_pages.py Doc/pages.dox
```

**2. Build the documentation**

```bash
doxygen Doc/doxygen.cfg
```

Alternatively, you can enable the `DILIGENT_BUILD_DOCS` CMake option to add the `DiligentDocs` target.

The generated documentation will be placed in `build/docs/html`.
Open `build/docs/html/index.html` in your browser to view the documentation.

# Doxyfile 1.13.2

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
#
# Note:
#
# Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
# Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
# replacement variables:
# doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Diligent Engine"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewers a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where Doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

# NB: the same path must specified in the documentation build action

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then Doxygen will create up to 4096
# sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format
# and will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding Doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise cause
# performance problems for the file system. Adapt CREATE_SUBDIRS_LEVEL to
# control the number of sub-directories.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = YES

# Controls the number of sub-directories that will be created when
# CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES. Level 0 represents 16 directories, and every
# level increment doubles the number of directories, resulting in 4096
# directories at level 8 which is the default and also the maximum value. The
# sub-directories are organized in 2 levels, the first level always has a fixed
# number of 16 directories.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 8, default value: 8.

CREATE_SUBDIRS_LEVEL   = 8

# If the ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES tag is set to YES, Doxygen will allow non-ASCII
# characters to appear in the names of generated files. If set to NO, non-ASCII

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by Doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.

# The default value is: YES.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand

SHORT_NAMES            = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot, question mark or exclamation mark) of a
# Javadoc-style comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-

# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = NO

# If the JAVADOC_BANNER tag is set to YES then Doxygen will interpret a line
# such as
# /***************
# as being the beginning of a Javadoc-style comment "banner". If set to NO, the

QT_AUTOBRIEF           = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen treat a
# multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as
# a brief description. This used to be the default behavior. The new default is
# to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this
# tag to YES if you prefer the old behavior instead.
#
# Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are
# not recognized any more.
# The default value is: NO.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# By default Python docstrings are displayed as preformatted text and Doxygen's
# special commands cannot be used. By setting PYTHON_DOCSTRING to NO the

# documentation from any documented member that it re-implements.
# The default value is: YES.

INHERIT_DOCS           = YES

# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will produce a new
# page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will be part
# of the file/class/namespace that contains it.
# The default value is: NO.

SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES  = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:^^"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". Note that you cannot put \n's in the value part of an alias
# to insert newlines (in the resulting output). You can put ^^ in the value part
# of an alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original
# file. When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you
# have to escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts
# with the commands \{ and \} for these it is advised to use the version @{ and
# @} or use a double escape (\\{ and \\})

# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_SLICE  = NO

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by Doxygen: IDL, Java, JavaScript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, Lex, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice,
# VHDL, Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files). For instance to make Doxygen treat .inc files
# as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is Fortran),
# use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise

# The size of the symbol lookup cache can be set using LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE. This

# Doxygen will become slower. If the cache is too large, memory is wasted. The
# cache size is given by this formula: 2^(16+LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range
# is 0..9, the default is 0, corresponding to a cache size of 2^16=65536
# symbols. At the end of a run Doxygen will report the cache usage and suggest

**A Modern Cross-Platform Low-Level 3D Graphics Library and Rendering Framework**
[![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=An%20easy-to-use%20cross-platform%20graphics%20library%20that%20takes%20full%20advantage%20of%20%23Direct3D12%20and%20%23VulkanAPI&url=https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine)

Diligent Engine is a lightweight, high-performance graphics API abstraction layer and rendering framework for cross-platform development.
It leverages the power of modern graphics APIs such as Direct3D12, Vulkan, Metal, and WebGPU, while also maintaining robust support for
legacy platforms through Direct3D11, OpenGL, OpenGLES, and WebGL.
Providing a consistent front-end API, Diligent Engine uses HLSL as its universal shading language and also supports platform-specific
shader formats (GLSL, MSL, DirectX bytecode, SPIR-V) for optimized performance.
Ideal for game engines, interactive simulations, and 3D visualization applications, Diligent Engine is open-source and distributed
under the permissive [Apache 2.0 license](License.txt).

# Cloning the Repository

This is the master repository that contains four [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). To get the repository and all submodules, use the following command:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine.git
```

When updating existing repository, don't forget to update all submodules:

```
git pull
git submodule update --recursive
```

It is also a good idea to re-run CMake and perform clean rebuild after getting the latest version.

<a name="repository_structure"></a>
## Repository Structure

Master repository includes the following submodules:

* [Core](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore) submodule implements 
  [Direct3D11](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/GraphicsEngineD3D11), 
  [Direct3D12](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/GraphicsEngineD3D12),
  [OpenGL/GLES](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/GraphicsEngineOpenGL), and
  [Vulkan](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/tree/master/Graphics/GraphicsEngineVulkan) back-ends.
  The module is self-contained and can be built by its own.
* [Tools](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools) submodule contains 
  [texture loading library](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/TextureLoader),
  [asset loading library](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/blob/master/AssetLoader),
  [dear imgui implementation](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/blob/master/Imgui),
  [native application implementation](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/blob/master/NativeApp),
  [Diligent render state notation parser](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderStateNotation) and
  [offline render state packaging tool](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderStatePackager).
* [DiligentFX](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentFX) is a high-level rendering framework that implements
  various rendering components. The module depends on Core and Tools modules.
* [Samples](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples) submodule contains tutorials and sample applications 
  intended to demonstrate the usage of the Diligent Engine API. The module depends on Core, Tools and DiligentFX modules.

# Build and Run Instructions

Diligent Engine uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as a cross-platform build tool. 
To start using cmake, download the [latest release](https://cmake.org/download/) (3.20 or later is required).
Another build prerequisite is [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.0 or later is required).
If after following the instructions below you have build/run issues, please take a look at [troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md).

<a name="build_and_run_win32"></a>
## Win32

Build prerequisites:

* Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0 or later
* C++ build tools
* Visual C++ ATL Support

.NET support requires .NET SDK 6.0 or later.

Use either CMake GUI or command line tool to generate build files. For example, to generate 
[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 64-bit solution and project files in *build/Win64* folder, 
navigate to the engine's root folder and run the following command:

```
cmake -S . -B ./build/Win64 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```

You can generate Win32 solution that targets Win8.1 SDK using the following command:

```
cmake -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=8.1 -S . -B ./build/Win64_8.1 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```

If you use MinGW, you can generate the make files using the command below (note however that the functionality
will be limited and that MinGW is not a recommended way to build the engine):

```
cmake -S . -B ./build/MinGW -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```

:warning: In current implementation, full path to cmake build folder **must not contain white spaces**.

To enable Vulkan validation layers, you will need to download the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) and add environment
variable `VK_LAYER_PATH` that contains the path to the *Bin* directory in VulkanSDK installation folder.

Open *DiligentEngine.sln* file in *build/Win64* folder, select configuration and build the engine. Set the desired project
as startup project (by default, GLTF Viewer will be selected) and run it. 

By default, sample and tutorial applications will show rendering backend selection dialog box. Use the following command line options to force
D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL, or Vulkan mode: **--mode d3d11**, **--mode d3d12**, **--mode gl**, or **--mode vk**. If you want to run an application
outside of Visual Studio environment, the application's assets folder must be set as working directory. (For Visual Studio, this 
is automatically configured by CMake). Alternatively, you can navigate to the build target or install folder and run the executable from there.


<a name="build_and_run_uwp"></a>
## Universal Windows Platform

To generate build files for Universal Windows platform, you need to define the following two cmake variables:

* `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=WindowsStore`
* `CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=< Windows Version >`

For example, to generate Visual Studio 2022 64-bit solution and project files in *build/UWP64* folder, run the following command
from the engine's root folder:

```
cmake -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=WindowsStore -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=10.0 -S . -B ./build/UWP64 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```

Set the desired project as startup project (by default, GLTF Viewer will be selected) and run it. 

By default, applications will run in D3D12 mode. You can select D3D11 or D3D12 using the following command line options:
**--mode d3d11**, **--mode d3d12**.

Note: it is possible to generate solution that targets Windows 8.1 by defining CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=8.1 cmake variable, but it will fail
to build as it will use Visual Studio 2013 (v120) toolset that lacks proper c++14 support.


<a name="build_and_run_linux"></a>
## Linux

Your Linux environment needs to be set up for c++ development. If it already is, make sure your c++ tools are up to date
as Diligent Engine uses modern c++ features (clang 10 or later is recommended).

:warning: gcc 9 and above seemingly produces invalid binary code with O2 and O3 optimization levels. To avoid crashes,
optimization level is downgraded to O1 in release configurations. It is recommended to use clang or gcc 7 or 8.

You may need to install the following packages:

1. gcc, clang, make and other essential c/c++ tools:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

2. cmake

```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

3. Other required packages:

```
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
sudo apt-get install libgl-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-distutils
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev
sudo apt-get install libxinerama-dev
sudo apt-get install libxcursor-dev
sudo apt-get install libxi-dev
```

To configure Vulkan you will also need to:

* Install latest Vulkan drivers and libraries for your GPU
* Install [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
  * To make sure that you system is properly configured you can try to build and run samples from the SDK

To generate make files for debug configuration, run the following CMake command from the engine's root folder:

```
cmake -S . -B ./build -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
```

To build the engine, run the following command:

```
cmake --build ./build
```

On Ubuntu 23 and newer, it may crash if you don't have libtinfo5 installed, you'll need to [add it](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1491254/installing-cuda-on-ubuntu-23-10-libt5info-not-installable).
 

The engine's root folder contains [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings files that configure
the IDE to build the engine. You can run applications directly from the IDE. To run an application from the command line,
the app's assets folder must be current directory.


<a name="build_and_run_android"></a>
## Android

Please make sure that your machine is set up for Android development. Download 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html),
[install and configure the NDK and CMake](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk)
and other required tools. NDK r24 or later is required. If you are not using CMake version bundled with Android Studio, make sure
your build files are [properly configured](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code.html#use_a_custom_cmake_version).
To verify that your environment is properly set up, try building the
[teapots sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk/tree/master/teapots) as well as
[Vulkan Android tutorials](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vulkan-tutorials).

Open *DiligentSamples/Android* folder with Android Studio to build and run tutorials and samples on Android.

By default, applications will run in Vulkan mode. To run them in Vulkan mode, add the following launch flags:
`--es mode gles` (in Android Studio, go to Run->Edit Configurations menu)

<a name="build_and_run_macos"></a>
## MacOS

Prerequisites:

* Xcode 16 or later
* Vulkan SDK 1.4.335.1 or later to enable Vulkan

After you clone the repo, run the following command from the engine's root folder to generate Xcode project:

```
cmake -S . -B ./build/MacOS -G "Xcode"
```

The project will be located in `build/MacOS` folder.

Note that if CMake fails to find the compiler, you may need to run the following command:

```
sudo xcode-select --reset
```

### Configuring Vulkan Build Environment

By default there is no Vulkan implementation on MacOS. Diligent Engine loads Vulkan dynamically
and can use a Vulkan Portability implementation such as [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)
or [gfx-portability](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability). Install [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac)
and make sure that your system is properly configured as described
[here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/latest/mac/getting_started.html#user-content-sdk-system-paths).
In particular, you may need to define the following environment variables (assuming that Vulkan SDK is installed at
`/Users/MyName/VulkanSDK/1.4.335.1` and you want to use MoltenVK):

```
export VULKAN_SDK=/Users/MyName/VulkanSDK/1.4.335.1/macOS
export PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/bin:$PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export VK_ADD_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=$VULKAN_SDK/share/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json
export VK_DRIVER_FILES=$VULKAN_SDK/share/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json
```

Note that environment variables set in the shell are not seen by the applications launched from Launchpad
or other desktop GUI. Thus to make sure that an application finds Vulkan libraries, it needs to be started from 
the command line. Due to the same reason, the xcode project file should also be opened from the shell using 
`open` command. With Xcode versions 7 and later, this behavior may need to be enabled first using the
following command:

```
defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode UseSanitizedBuildSystemEnvironment -bool NO
```

Please refer to [this page](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/mac/getting_started.html) for more details.

:warning: `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables are ignored on MacOS unless
System Integrity Protection is disabled (which generally is not recommended). In order for executables to find the
Vulkan library, it must be in rpath. If `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is set and points to correct location, Diligent
Engine will configure the rpath for all applications automatically.

Latest tested Vulkan SDK version: 1.4.335.1.

:warning: There are known issues with later versions of the SDK, so it is recommended to use the latest tested version.

<a name="build_and_run_ios"></a>
## iOS

Prerequisites:

* Xcode 16 or later
* Vulkan SDK 1.4.335.1 or later to enable Vulkan

Run the command below from the engine's root folder to generate Xcode project configured for
[iOS build](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html#cross-compiling-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos):

```cmake
cmake -S . -B ./build/iOS -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -G "Xcode"
```

If needed, you can provide iOS deployment target (13.0 or later is required) as well as other parameters, e.g.:

```cmake
cmake -S . -B ./build/iOS -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0 -G "Xcode"
```

:warning: To build for iPhone simulator, use the `iphonesimulator` system root. You may also use the
`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` variable to specify target architecture, for example:

```cmake
cmake -S . -B ./build/iOSSim -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphonesimulator -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 -G "Xcode"
```

Open Xcode project file in `build/IOS` folder and build the engine. To run the applications on an iOS device,
you will need to set appropriate development team in the project settings.

### Configuring Vulkan Build Environment

To enable Vulkan on iOS, download and install the [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac). There is no Vulkan loader
on iOS, and Diligent Engine links directly with MoltenVK XCFramework (see
[MoltenVk install guide](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/master/Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md#install-moltenvk-as-a-universal-xcframework))
that implements Vulkan on Metal. To enable Vulkan in Diligent Engine on iOS, specify the path to Vulkan SDK 
when running CMake, for example (assuming that Vulkan SDK is installed at `/Users/MyName/VulkanSDK/1.4.335.1`):

```cmake
cmake -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DVULKAN_SDK=/Users/MyName/VulkanSDK/1.4.335.1 -S . -B ./build/iOS -G "Xcode"
```

By default, the engine links with MoltenVK XCFramework located in Vulkan SDK. If this is not desired or an application wants
to use a specific library, it can provide the full path to the library via `MOLTENVK_LIBRARY` CMake variable.

Refer to [MoltenVK user guide](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/master/Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md#install)
for more information about MoltenVK installation and usage.

Latest tested Vulkan SDK version: 1.4.335.1.

:warning: There are known issues with later versions of the SDK, so it is recommended to use the latest tested version.

<a name="build_and_run_web"></a>
## Web
Build prerequisites:

* Emscripten SDK 3.1.65
* Ninja 1.10.2

To activate PATH and other environment variables in the current terminal
````bash
source ${PATH_TO_EMSDK}/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
````
:warning: On Windows, run `${PATH_TO_EMSDK}/emsdk/emsdk_env.bat` instead of `source ${PATH_TO_EMSDK}/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh`


To generate project, run the following CMake command from the engine's root folder:

```cmake
emcmake cmake -S . -B ./build/Emscripten -G "Ninja"
```

To build the engine, run the following command:

```cmake
cmake --build ./build/Emscripten
```

To test Web applications, run a basic web server

```bash
cd ./build/Emscripten
python https_server.py
```

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost`

For example, the Hello Triangle tutorial will be available at 

```
http://localhost/DiligentSamples/Tutorials/Tutorial01_HelloTriangle/Tutorial01_HelloTriangle.html
```

To access the server from another computer on the local network, use the HTTPS server.
To enable this, first install the `cryptography` module. You can do so by running the following command:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

To start the HTTPS server, use the following command:

```bash
python https_server.py --mode=https
```

Use the HTTPS protocol to open the pages. For example:

```
https://localhost/DiligentSamples/Tutorials/Tutorial01_HelloTriangle/Tutorial01_HelloTriangle.html
```

When using the HTTPS server, unlike with the HTTP server, you may encounter the following error
when loading the page: `net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`.

There are two ways to resolve this issue:
1. Click the `Advanced` button and then select `Proceed to localhost (unsafe)`.
2. Alternatively, start the terminal as administrator and run the following command:

```bash
python https_server.py --mode=https --register
```

We use the default ports for HTTP/HTTPS protocols, `80` and `443` respectively. 
If you already have a server running on those ports, you may specify a different port number using the `--port`
argument and include the corresponding port number in the URL after the IP address. For example:

```
http://localhost:${YOUR_PORT}/DiligentSamples/Tutorials/Tutorial01_HelloTriangle/Tutorial01_HelloTriangle.html
```

<a name="build_and_run_integration"></a>
## Integrating Diligent Engine with Existing Build System

Diligent has modular structure, so for your project you can only use those 
submodules that implement the required functionality.
The diagram below shows the dependencies between modules.

```
  Core
   |
   +------>Tools----------.
   |        |             |
   |        V             |
   +------->FX---------.  |
   |                   |  |
   |                   V  V
   '----------------->Samples
```

Don't forget to recursively initialize submodules if you are adding Diligent repos
as submodules to your project.

### Your Project Uses Cmake

If your project uses CMake, adding Diligent Engine requires just few lines of code. 
Suppose that the directory structure looks like this:

```
|
+-DiligentCore
+-HelloDiligent.cpp
```

Then the following steps need to be done:
* Call `add_subdirectory(DiligentCore)`
* Add dependencies on the targets implementing required rendering backends

Below is an example of a CMake file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.6)

project(HelloDiligent CXX)

add_subdirectory(DiligentCore)

add_executable(HelloDiligent WIN32 HelloDiligent.cpp)
target_compile_options(HelloDiligent PRIVATE -DUNICODE)

target_link_libraries(HelloDiligent
PRIVATE
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineD3D11-shared
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineOpenGL-shared
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineD3D12-shared
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineVk-shared
)
copy_required_dlls(HelloDiligent)
```

`copy_required_dlls()` is a convenience function that copies shared libraries next to
the executable so that the system can find and load them. 
Please also take a look at getting started tutorials for 
[Windows](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples/tree/master/Tutorials/Tutorial00_HelloWin32) and 
[Linux](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples/tree/master/Tutorials/Tutorial00_HelloLinux).

#### Static vs Dynamic Linking

On most platforms, core engine libraries are built in both static and dynamic versions
(for example, `Diligent-GraphicsEngineD3D12-static` and `Diligent-GraphicsEngineD3D12-shared`).
You can choose which version to link with by changing the target name in `target_link_libraries()` CMake command.
When linking with dynamic libraries, the `ENGINE_DLL` macro will be defined, and the libraries will need to be loaded
at runtime. For example, for Direct3D12 backend:

```cpp
#if ENGINE_DLL
// Load the dll and import GetEngineFactoryD3D12() function
auto GetEngineFactoryD3D12 = LoadGraphicsEngineD3D12();
#endif
auto* pFactoryD3D12 = GetEngineFactoryD3D12();
```

When using static linking, the `ENGINE_DLL` macro will not be defined, and the `GetEngineFactoryD3D12` function will be
statically linked with the executable.

[SampleApp.cpp](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentSamples/blob/master/SampleBase/src/SampleApp.cpp) file provides
an example of how to initialize the engine on different platforms using static or dynamic linking.

#### Using FetchContent

You can use [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) to download Diligent Engine modules.
The only caveat is that you need to specify the source directory for each module to be the same as the module name,
so that header files can be found. Below is an example of a CMake file that uses FetchContent:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.6)

project(HelloDiligent CXX)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    DiligentCore
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore.git
    SOURCE_DIR _deps/DiligentCore
)
FetchContent_Declare(
    DiligentTools
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools.git
    SOURCE_DIR _deps/DiligentTools
)
FetchContent_Declare(
    DiligentFX
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentFX.git
    SOURCE_DIR _deps/DiligentFX
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(DiligentCore DiligentTools DiligentFX)

add_executable(HelloDiligent WIN32 HelloDiligent.cpp)
target_include_directories(HelloDiligent
PRIVATE
    ${diligentcore_SOURCE_DIR}
    ${diligenttools_SOURCE_DIR}
    ${diligentfx_SOURCE_DIR}
)

target_compile_definitions(HelloDiligent PRIVATE UNICODE)

target_link_libraries(HelloDiligent
PRIVATE
    Diligent-BuildSettings
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineD3D11-shared
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineD3D12-shared
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineOpenGL-shared
    Diligent-GraphicsEngineVk-shared
    DiligentFX
)
copy_required_dlls(HelloDiligent)
```

### Your Project Does Not Use Cmake

If your project doesn't use CMake, it is recommended to build libraries with CMake and add them to your build system.
You can download the latest build artifacts from [GitHub](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore/actions?query=branch%3Amaster).

Global CMake installation directory is controlled by
[CMAKE_INTALL_PREFIX](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html) variable. 
Note that it defaults to `/usr/local` on UNIX and `c:/Program Files/${PROJECT_NAME}` on Windows, which may not
be what you want. Use `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install` to use local `install` folder instead:

```
cmake -S . -B ./build/Win64 -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```

To install libraries and header files, run the following CMake command from the build folder:

```cmake
cmake --build . --target install
```

DiligentCore installation directory will contain everything required to integrate the engine:

* *include* subdirectory will contain all required header files. Add this directory to your include search directories.
* *lib* subdirectory will contain static libraries.
* *bin* subdirectory will contain dynamic libraries.

An easier way is to link with dynamic libraries. When linking statically, you will need to list DiligentCore as well 
as all third-party libraries used by the engine. Besides that, you will also need to specify platform-specific system libraries. 
For example, for Windows platform, the list of libraries your project will need to link against may look like this:

```
DiligentCore.lib glslang.lib HLSL.lib OGLCompiler.lib OSDependent.lib spirv-cross-core.lib SPIRV.lib SPIRV-Tools-opt.lib SPIRV-Tools.lib glew-static.lib GenericCodeGen.lib MachineIndependent.lib dxgi.lib d3d11.lib d3d12.lib d3dcompiler.lib opengl32.lib
```

Diligent Engine headers require one of the following platform macros to be defined as `1`:
`PLATFORM_WIN32`, `PLATFORM_UNIVERSAL_WINDOWS`, `PLATFORM_ANDROID`, `PLATFORM_LINUX`, `PLATFORM_MACOS`, `PLATFORM_IOS`.

You can control which components of the engine you want to install using the following CMake options:
`DILIGENT_INSTALL_CORE`, `DILIGENT_INSTALL_FX`, `DILIGENT_INSTALL_SAMPLES`, and `DILIGENT_INSTALL_TOOLS`.

Another way to integrate the engine is to generate build files (such as Visual Studio projects) and add them to your
build system. Build customization described below can help tweak the settings for your specific needs.

By default, all back-ends available on the current platform are built. To disable specific back-ends,
use the following options: `DILIGENT_NO_DIRECT3D11`, `DILIGENT_NO_DIRECT3D12`, `DILIGENT_NO_OPENGL`,
`DILIGENT_NO_VULKAN`, `DILIGENT_NO_METAL`, `DILIGENT_NO_WEBGPU`. WebGPU backend is enabled by default when building
for the Web. To enable it on other platforms, use `DILIGENT_NO_WEBGPU=OFF`.
The options can be set through cmake UI or from the command line as in the example below:

```
cmake -D DILIGENT_NO_DIRECT3D11=TRUE -S . -B ./build/Win64 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```

Additionally, individual engine components can be enabled or disabled using the following options:
`DILIGENT_BUILD_TOOLS`, `DILIGENT_BUILD_FX`, `DILIGENT_BUILD_SAMPLES`.
If you only want to build `SampleBase` project, you can use `DILIGENT_BUILD_SAMPLE_BASE_ONLY` option.

By default Vulkan back-end is linked with glslang that enables compiling HLSL and GLSL shaders to SPIRV at run time.
If run-time compilation is not required, glslang can be disabled with `DILIGENT_NO_GLSLANG` cmake option. 
Additionally, HLSL support in non-Direct3D backends can be disabled with `DILIGENT_NO_HLSL` option.
Enabling the options significantly reduces the size of Vulkan and OpenGL back-end binaries, which may be
especially important for mobile applications.

Diligent Engine uses [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to ensure consistent
formatting throughout the code base. The validation can be disabled using `DILIGENT_NO_FORMAT_VALIDATION`
CMake option. Note that any pull request will fail if formatting issues are found.

Diligent Engine uses extensive validation that is always enabled in Debug build. Some of the checks may be
enabled in release configurations by setting `DILIGENT_DEVELOPMENT` CMake option.

To enable PIX events support, set `DILIGENT_LOAD_PIX_EVENT_RUNTIME` CMake flag.

To enable some advanced features on NVidia GPUs (such as native multi draw indirect support in Direct3D11),
download [NVAPI](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvapi) and set the `DILIGENT_NVAPI_PATH` CMake variable. 

Diligent Engine uses multiple third-party libraries. If an application's CMake file defines any of
those libraries, Diligent will use existing targets. The application will need to make sure that
build settings are compatible with Diligent.

<a name="build_and_run_customizing"></a>
## Customizing Build

Diligent Engine allows clients to customize build settings by providing configuration script file that defines the following optional 
[cmake functions](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/function.html):

* `custom_configure_build()` - defines global build properties such as build configurations, c/c++ compile flags, link flags etc.
* `custom_pre_configure_target()` - defines custom settings for every target in the build and is called before the engine's
                                    build system starts configuring the target.
* `custom_post_configure_target()` - called after the engine's build system has configured the target to let the client
                                     override properties set by the engine.

The path to the configuration script should be provided through `BUILD_CONFIGURATION_FILE` variable when running 
cmake and must be relative to the cmake root folder, for example:

```
cmake -D BUILD_CONFIGURATION_FILE=BuildConfig.cmake -S . -B ./build/Win64 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```

### Customizing global build settings with custom_configure_build() function

If defined, `custom_configure_build()` function is called before any build target is added. By default,
cmake defines the following four configurations: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel. If you want, 
you can define your own build configurations by setting `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` variable. For instance,
if you want to have only two configuration: Debug and ReleaseMT, add the following line to the `custom_configure_build()`
function:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Debug ReleaseMT CACHE STRING "Configuration types: Debug, ReleaseMT" FORCE)
```

The build system needs to know the list of debug and release (optimized) configurations, so the following
two variables must also be set when `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` variable is defined:

```cmake
set(DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(RELEASE_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASEMT CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
```

Note that due to cmake specifics, configuration names listed in `DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS` and `RELEASE_CONFIGURATIONS`
**must be capitalized**.

If you define any configuration other than four standard cmake ones, you also need to set the following variables, for every
new configuration:

* `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<Config>` - c compile flags
* `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_<Config>` - c++ compile flags
* `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<Config>` - executable link flags
* `CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<Config>` - shared library link flags

For instance:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
```

Below is an example of custom_configure_build() function:

```cmake
function(custom_configure_build)
    if(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES)
        # Debug configurations
        set(DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        # Release (optimized) configurations
        set(RELEASE_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASEMT CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        # CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES variable defines build configurations generated by cmake
        set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Debug ReleaseMT CACHE STRING "Configuration types: Debug, ReleaseMT" FORCE)

        set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/MT" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
        set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASEMT "/OPT:REF" CACHE INTERNAL "" FORCE)
    endif()
endfunction()
```


### Customizing individual target build settings with custom_pre_configure_target() and custom_post_configure_target() functions

If defined, `custom_pre_configure_target()` is called for every target created by the build system and
allows configuring target-specific properties.

By default, the build system sets some target properties. If `custom_pre_configure_target()` sets all required properties,
it can tell the build system that no further processing is required by setting `TARGET_CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE`
[parent scope](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set.html#set-normal-variable) variable to `TRUE`:

```cmake
set(TARGET_CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE TRUE PARENT_SCOPE)
```

The following is an example of `custom_pre_configure_target()` function:

```cmake
function(custom_pre_configure_target TARGET)
    set_target_properties(${TARGET} PROPERTIES
        STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_RELEASEMT /LTCG
    )
    set(TARGET_CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE TRUE PARENT_SCOPE)   
endfunction()
```

If the client only needs to override some settings, it may define `custom_post_configure_target()` function that is called
after the engine has completed configuring the target, for example:

```cmake
function(custom_post_configure_target TARGET)
    set_target_properties(${TARGET} PROPERTIES
        CXX_STANDARD 17
    )
endfunction()
```

# Getting started with the API

Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentCore#api-basics). Also, tutorials and samples listed below is a good place to start.


<a name="render_state_notation"></a>
# Render State Notation

Diligent Render State Notation is a JSON-based language that describes shaders, pipeline states,
resource signatures and other objects in a convenient form, e.g.:

```json
{
    "Shaders": [
        {
            "Desc": {
                "Name": "My Vertex shader",
                "ShaderType": "VERTEX"
            },
            "SourceLanguage": "HLSL",
            "FilePath": "cube.vsh"
        },
        {
            "Desc": {
                "Name": "My Pixel shader",
                "ShaderType": "PIXEL"
            },
            "SourceLanguage": "HLSL",
            "FilePath": "cube.psh",
        }
    ],
    "Pipeleines": [
        {
            "GraphicsPipeline": {
                "DepthStencilDesc": {
                    "DepthEnable": true
                },
                "RTVFormats": {
                    "0": "RGBA8_UNORM_SRGB"
                },
                "RasterizerDesc": {
                    "CullMode": "FRONT"
                },
                "BlendDesc": {
                    "RenderTargets": {
                        "0": {
                            "BlendEnable": true
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            "PSODesc": {
                "Name": "My Pipeline State",
                "PipelineType": "GRAPHICS"
            },
            "pVS": "My Vertex shader",
            "pPS": "My Pixel shader"
        }
    ]
}
```

JSON files can be [parsed dynamically at run time](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderStateNotation/interface).
Alternatively, an application can use the [packager tool](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools/tree/master/RenderStatePackager) to preprocess pipeline
descriptions (compile shaders for target platforms, define internal resource layouts, etc.) into a binary archive optimized for run-time loading performance.

# Troubleshooting

## Build fails

* Make sure your code is up-to-date. When updating existing repository, don't forget to update all submodules:

```
git pull
git submodule update --recursive
```

* Try to [get clean version](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine#cloning-the-repository)

* Make sure your build environment is up-to-date and properly configured:
  * When building with Visual Studio, make sure you use Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0 or later,
    have C++ build tools and Visual C++ ATL Support installed.
  * When building for UWP, make sure you have UWP build tools.
  * When building for Android, make sure all your tools are up to date, you have
    [NDK and CMake installed](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk).
    If you are not using CMake version bundled with Android Studio, make sure your build files are
    [properly configured](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code.html#use_a_custom_cmake_version).
  * When using gcc, make sure the compiler version is at least 7.4.
  * gcc 9, 10 and 11 seemingly produce invalid code in release configurations that causes crash on startup.
    Use gcc 7 or 8 or clang.
  * Make sure you build the project with c++14 features enabled.

* When including Diligent headers, make sure that exactly one of `PLATFORM_WIN32`,
  `PLATFORM_UNIVERSAL_WINDOWS`, `PLATFORM_ANDROID`, `PLATFORM_LINUX`, `PLATFORM_MACOS`, and
  `PLATFORM_IOS` macros is defined as `1`.

* When building on Windows, generating Visual Studio project files is the recommended way.
  Other IDEs such as Visual Studio Code or CLion may need extra configuration to properly set up
  the build environment.

* If on Windows you get long path error, try cloning the project to a folder with shorter name
  such as `c:/git/DiligentEngine`.

* If on MacOS CMake fails to find the compiler, run the following command:
  ```cmake
  sudo xcode-select --reset
  ```  

## Projects don't run

* When running from the command line, make sure that the project's `assets` folder is set as working directory
* Try using different backends: use `-mode d3d11` or `-mode gl` command line options
