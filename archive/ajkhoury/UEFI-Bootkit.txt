GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

# UEFI-Bootkit

A small bootkit designed to use zero assembly. Make sure to compile the driver as an EFI Runtime driver (EFI_RUNTIME_DRIVER) or else the bootkit will be freed once winload.efi calls ExitBootServices!

Installation Instructions

Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005,
2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

This file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives
unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.  The following
more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
instructions specific to this package.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
reconfiguring for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).

Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:

     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash

`configure' Invocation
======================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.

Udis86
======

Udis86 is a disassembler for the x86 and x86-64 class of instruction set
architectures. It consists of a C library called libudis86 which
provides a clean and simple interface to decode a stream of raw binary
data, and to inspect the disassembled instructions in a structured
manner.


LICENSE
-------

Udis86 is distributed under the terms of the 2-clause "Simplified BSD
License".  A copy of the license is included with the source in LICENSE.


libudis86
---------

  o Supports all x86 and x86-64 (AMD64) General purpose and
    System instructions.
  o Supported ISA extensions:
    - MMX, FPU (x87), AMD 3DNow
    - SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AES,
    - AMD-V, INTEL-VMX, SMX
  o Instructions are defined in an XML document, with opcode
    tables generated for performance.
  o Supports output in both INTEL (NASM) as well as AT&T (GNU as) style
    assembly language syntax.
  o Supports a variety of input methods: Files, Memory Buffers, and
    Function Callback hooks.
  o Re-entrant, no dynamic memory allocation.
  o Fully documented API


  -- EXAMPLE -----------------------------------------------------------
    
    ud_t u;
    
    ud_init(&u);
    ud_set_input_file(&u, stdin);
    ud_set_mode(&u, 64);
    ud_set_syntax(&u, UD_SYN_INTEL);
    
    while (ud_disassemble(&u)) {
      printf("\t%s\n", ud_insn_asm(&ud_obj));
    }

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    

udcli
-----

udcli is a small command-line tool for your quick disassembly needs.

  -- EXAMPLE -----------------------------------------------------------

    $ echo "65 67 89 87 76 65 54 56 78 89 09 00 90" | udcli -32 -x 
    0000000080000800 656789877665     mov [gs:bx+0x6576], eax
    0000000080000806 54               push esp
    0000000080000807 56               push esi
    0000000080000808 7889             js 0x80000793
    000000008000080a 0900             or [eax], eax
    000000008000080c 90               nop

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------


Documentation
-------------

The libudis86 api is fully documented. The package distribution contains
a Texinfo file which can be installed by invoking "make install-info".
You can also find an online html version of the documentation available
at http://udis86.sourceforge.net/.


Autotools Build
---------------

You need autotools if building from sources cloned form version control
system, or if you need to regenerate the build system. The wrapper
script 'autogen.sh' is provided that'll generate the build system.

# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
# $ac_aux_dir to '$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
# '$srcdir', '$srcdir/..', or '$srcdir/../..'.
#
# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
#
# $ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
#
# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
# harmless because $srcdir is '.', but things will broke when you
# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
#
# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
# and then we would define $MISSING as
#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
#
# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

\`configure' configures udis86 1.7.2 to adapt to many kinds of systems.

Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.

Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.

Configuration:
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
      --help=short        display options specific to this package
      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
  -V, --version           display version information and exit
  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

Installation directories:
  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                          [$ac_default_prefix]
  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                          [PREFIX]

By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.

For better control, use the options below.

Fine tuning of the installation directories:
  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
  --libexecdir=DIR        program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]
  --sysconfdir=DIR        read-only single-machine data [PREFIX/etc]
  --sharedstatedir=DIR    modifiable architecture-independent data [PREFIX/com]
  --localstatedir=DIR     modifiable single-machine data [PREFIX/var]
  --libdir=DIR            object code libraries [EPREFIX/lib]
  --includedir=DIR        C header files [PREFIX/include]
  --oldincludedir=DIR     C header files for non-gcc [/usr/include]
  --datarootdir=DIR       read-only arch.-independent data root [PREFIX/share]
  --datadir=DIR           read-only architecture-independent data [DATAROOTDIR]
  --infodir=DIR           info documentation [DATAROOTDIR/info]
  --localedir=DIR         locale-dependent data [DATAROOTDIR/locale]
  --mandir=DIR            man documentation [DATAROOTDIR/man]
  --docdir=DIR            documentation root [DATAROOTDIR/doc/udis86]
  --htmldir=DIR           html documentation [DOCDIR]
  --dvidir=DIR            dvi documentation [DOCDIR]
  --pdfdir=DIR            pdf documentation [DOCDIR]
  --psdir=DIR             ps documentation [DOCDIR]

Program names:
  --program-prefix=PREFIX            prepend PREFIX to installed program names
  --program-suffix=SUFFIX            append SUFFIX to installed program names
  --program-transform-name=PROGRAM   run sed PROGRAM on installed program names

System types:
  --build=BUILD     configure for building on BUILD [guessed]
  --host=HOST       cross-compile to build programs to run on HOST [BUILD]

Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --enable-silent-rules   less verbose build output (undo: "make V=1")
  --disable-silent-rules  verbose build output (undo: "make V=0")
  --enable-dependency-tracking
                          do not reject slow dependency extractors
  --disable-dependency-tracking
                          speeds up one-time build
  --enable-shared[=PKGS]  build shared libraries [default=no]
  --enable-static[=PKGS]  build static libraries [default=yes]
  --enable-fast-install[=PKGS]
                          optimize for fast installation [default=yes]
  --disable-libtool-lock  avoid locking (might break parallel builds)

Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --with-pic[=PKGS]       try to use only PIC/non-PIC objects [default=use
                          both]
  --with-gnu-ld           assume the C compiler uses GNU ld [default=no]
  --with-sysroot=DIR Search for dependent libraries within DIR
                        (or the compiler's sysroot if not specified).
  --with-python=[[PATH]]
                          absolute path to python executable
  --with-yasm=[[PATH]]  absolute path to yasm executable
  --with-sphinx-build=[[PATH]]
                          absolute path to sphinx-build executable

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor
  PYTHON      Absolute path to python executable
  YASM        Absolute path to yasm executable
  SPHINX_BUILD
              Absolute path to sphinx-build executable

Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_COMPARE_VERSION(VERSION_A, OP, VERSION_B, [ACTION-IF-TRUE], [ACTION-IF-FALSE])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro compares two version strings. Due to the various number of
#   minor-version numbers that can exist, and the fact that string
#   comparisons are not compatible with numeric comparisons, this is not
#   necessarily trivial to do in a autoconf script. This macro makes doing
#   these comparisons easy.
#
#   The six basic comparisons are available, as well as checking equality
#   limited to a certain number of minor-version levels.
#
#   The operator OP determines what type of comparison to do, and can be one
#   of:
#
#    eq  - equal (test A == B)
#    ne  - not equal (test A != B)
#    le  - less than or equal (test A <= B)
#    ge  - greater than or equal (test A >= B)
#    lt  - less than (test A < B)
#    gt  - greater than (test A > B)
#
#   Additionally, the eq and ne operator can have a number after it to limit
#   the test to that number of minor versions.
#
#    eq0 - equal up to the length of the shorter version
#    ne0 - not equal up to the length of the shorter version
#    eqN - equal up to N sub-version levels
#    neN - not equal up to N sub-version levels
#
#   When the condition is true, shell commands ACTION-IF-TRUE are run,
#   otherwise shell commands ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. The environment
#   variable 'ax_compare_version' is always set to either 'true' or 'false'
#   as well.
#
#   Examples:
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[lt],[3.15.8])
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15],[lt],[3.15.8])
#
#   would both be true.
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq],[3.15.8])
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15],[gt],[3.15.8])
#
#   would both be false.
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq2],[3.15.8])
#
#   would be true because it is only comparing two minor versions.
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq0],[3.15])
#
#   would be true because it is only comparing the lesser number of minor
#   versions of the two values.
#
#   Note: The characters that separate the version numbers do not matter. An
#   empty string is the same as version 0. OP is evaluated by autoconf, not
#   configure, so must be a string, not a variable.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_SPHINX_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Makes sure that sphinx-build supports the version indicated. If true
#   the shell commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell
#   commands in ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $SPHINX_BUILD is not set
#   (for example by running AX_WITH_PROG) the macro will fail.
#
#   Example:
#
#     AX_WITH_PROG(SPHINX_BUILD,sphinx-build)
#     AX_PROG_SPHINX([1.1.1],[ ... ],[ ... ])

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_WITH_PROG([VARIABLE],[program],[VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND],[PATH])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Locates an installed program binary, placing the result in the precious
#   variable VARIABLE. Accepts a present VARIABLE, then --with-program, and
#   failing that searches for program in the given path (which defaults to
#   the system path). If program is found, VARIABLE is set to the full path
#   of the binary; if it is not found VARIABLE is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND
#   if provided, unchanged otherwise.
#
#   A typical example could be the following one:
#
#         AX_WITH_PROG(PERL,perl)
#
#   NOTE: This macro is based upon the original AX_WITH_PYTHON macro from
#   Dustin J. Mitchell <dustin@cs.uchicago.edu>.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_WITH_PYTHON([VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND],[PATH])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Locates an installed Python binary, placing the result in the precious
#   variable $PYTHON. Accepts a present $PYTHON, then --with-python, and
#   failing that searches for python in the given path (which defaults to
#   the system path). If python is found, $PYTHON is set to the full path of
#   the binary; if it is not found $PYTHON is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND if
#   provided, unchanged otherwise.
#
#   A typical use could be the following one:

Getting Started
===============


Building and Installing udis86
------------------------------

udis86 is developed for unix-like environments, and like most software,
the basic steps towards building and installing it are as follows.

.. code::

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

Depending on your choice of install location, you may need to have root
privileges to do an install. The install scripts copy the necessary header
and library files to appropriate locations in your system.


Interfacing with libudis86: A Quick Example
-------------------------------------------

The following is an example of a program that interfaces with libudis86
and uses the API to generate assembly language output for 64-bit code,
input from STDIN.

.. code-block:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <udis86.h>

    int main()
    {
        ud_t ud_obj;

        ud_init(&ud_obj);
        ud_set_input_file(&ud_obj, stdin);
        ud_set_mode(&ud_obj, 64);
        ud_set_syntax(&ud_obj, UD_SYN_INTEL);

        while (ud_disassemble(&ud_obj)) {
            printf("\t%s\n", ud_insn_asm(&ud_obj));
        }

        return 0;
    }

To compile the program (using gcc):

.. code::

    $ gcc -ludis86 example.c -o example

This example should give you an idea of how this library can be used. The
following sections describe, in detail, the complete API of libudis86.

```

Welcome to udis86's documentation!
==================================

Udis86 is a disassembler engine that decodes a stream of binary
machine code bytes as opcodes defined in the x86 and x86-64 class
of Instruction Set Archictures. The core component of this project
is libudis86 which provides a clean and simple interface to
disassemble binary code, and to inspect the disassembly to various
degrees of detail. The library is designed to aid software
projects that entail analysis and manipulation of all flavors of
x86 binary code.

```rst
libudis86
=========

libudis86 is a disassembler library for the x86 architecture, including support
for the newer 64bit variants (IA32e, amd64, etc.) It provides you the ability
to decode a stream of bytes as x86 instructions, inspect various bits
of information about those instructions and even translate to human readable
assembly language format.

.. default-domain:: c

.. contents::
 

ud_t: udis86 object
-------------------

libudis86 is reentrant, and to maintain that property it does not use static
data. All data related to the disassembly are stored in a single object, called
the udis86 object :type:`ud_t`. 

.. c:type:: ud_t

    A structure encapsulating udis86 disassembler state.

To use libudis86 you must create an instance of this object,

.. code-block:: c

    ud_t ud_obj;

and initialize it,

.. code-block:: c

    ud_init(&ud_obj);

You can create multiple such objects and use with the library, each one
an independent disassembler.


Setup Machine State
-------------------

The decode semantics of a sequence of bytes depends on the target machine state
for which they are being disassembled. In x86, this means the current effective
processor mode (16, 32 or 64bits), the current program counter (ip/eip/rip), and
sometimes, the processor vendor. By default, libudis86 is initialized to be in
32 bit disassembly mode, program counter at 0, and vendor being :code:`UD_VENDOR_ANY`.
The following functions allow you to override these default to suit your needs.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_mode(ud_t*, uint8_t mode_bits)

    Sets the mode of disassembly. Possible values are 16, 32, and 64. By
    default, the library works in 32bit mode.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_pc(ud_t*, uint64_t pc)

    Sets the program counter (IP/EIP/RIP). This changes the offset of the
    assembly output generated, with direct effect on branch instructions.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_vendor(ud_t*, unsigned vendor)

    Sets the vendor of whose instruction to choose from. This is only useful
    for selecting the VMX or SVM instruction sets at which point INTEL and AMD
    have diverged significantly. At a later stage, support for a more granular
    selection of instruction sets maybe added.

    * :code:`UD_VENDOR_INTEL` - for INTEL instruction set.
    * :code:`UD_VENDOR_ATT` - for AMD instruction set.
    * :code:`UD_VENDOR_ANY` - for any valid instruction in either INTEL or AMD.


Setup Input
-----------

libudis86 provides three ways in which you can input binary data: as a fixed
sized memory buffer, a standard library FILE object, or as a callback function.
By default, a :type:`ud_t` object is initialized to read input from :code:`STDIN`.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_input_buffer(ud_t*, unsigned char* buffer, size_t size)

    Sets the input source for the library to a `buffer` of `size` bytes.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_input_file(ud_t*, FILE* filep)

    Sets the input source to a file pointed to by a given standard library
    :code:`FILE` pointer. Note that libudis86 does not perform any checks,
    and assumes that the file pointer is properly initialized and open for
    reading.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_input_hook(ud_t* ud_obj, int (*hook)(ud_t *ud_obj))

    Sets a pointer to a function, to callback for input. The callback is invoked
    each time libudis86 needs the next byte in the input stream. To single
    end-of-input, this callback must return the constant :code:`UD_EOI`.

    .. seealso:: :func:`ud_set_user_opaque_data`, :func:`ud_set_user_opaque_data`

.. c:function:: void ud_input_skip(ud_t*, size_t n);

    Skips ahead `n` number of bytes in the input stream.


.. c:function:: int ud_input_end(const ud_t*);

    Test for end of input. You can use this function to test if udis86
    has exhausted the input.

At the end of input, udis86 stops disassembly. If you want to restart or
reset the source of input, you must again invoke one of the above functions.

Sometimes you may want to associate custom data with a udis86 object, that you
can use with the input callback function, or even in different parts of your
own project as you pass the object around. You can use the following two
functions to achieve this.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_user_opaque_data(ud_t* ud_obj, void* opaque)

    Associates a pointer with the udis86 object to be retrieved and used in
    client functions, such as the input hook callback function.

.. c:function:: void* ud_get_user_opaque_data(const ud_t* ud_obj)

    Returns any pointer associated with the udis86 object, using the
    :func:`ud_set_user_opaque_data` function.


Setup Translation
-----------------

libudis86 can translate the decoded instruction into one of two assembly
language dialects: the INTEL syntax (such as those found in NASM and YASM) and
the other which resembles GNU Assembler (AT&T style) syntax. By default, this
is set to INTEL like syntax. You can override the default or specify your own
translator using the following function.

.. c:function:: void ud_set_syntax(ud_t*, void (*translator)(ud_t*))

    Sets the function that translates the intermediate decode information to
    a human readable form. There are two inbuilt translators,

    - :code:`UD_SYN_INTEL` for INTEL (NASM-like) syntax. (default)
    - :code:`UD_SYN_ATT` for AT&T (GAS-like) syntax.

    If you do not want libudis86 to translate, you can pass :code:`NULL` to the
    function, with no more translations thereafter. This is useful when you
    only want to identify chunks of code and then create the assembly output if
    needed, or when you are only interested in examining the instructions and
    do not want to waste cycles generating the assembly language output.

    If you want to create your own translator, you can specify a pointer to your
    own function. This function must accept a single parameter, the udis86 object
    :type:`ud_t`, and it will be invoked everytime an instruction is decoded.


Disassemble
-----------

With target state and input source set up, you can now disassemble. At the core
of libudis86 api is the function :c:func:`ud_disassemble` which does this.
libudis86 exposes decoded instructions in an intermediate form meant to be
useful for programs that want to examine them. This intermediate form is
available using functions and fields of :type:`ud_t` as described below.


.. c:function:: unsigned int ud_disassemble(ud_t*)

    Disassembles the next instruction in the input stream.
    
    :returns: the number of bytes disassembled. A 0 indicates end of input.
    
    Note, to restart disassembly after the end of input, you must call one of
    the input setting functions with a new source of input.

    A common use-case pattern for this function is in a loop::

        while (ud_disassemble(&ud_obj)) {
            /* 
             * use or print decode info.
             */
        }

For each successful invocation of :c:func:`ud_disassemble`, you can use the
following functions to get information about the disassembled instruction.


.. c:function:: unsigned int ud_insn_len(const ud_t* u)

    Returns the number of bytes disassembled.

.. c:function:: uint64_t ud_insn_off(const ud_t*)

    Returns the offset of the disassembled instruction in terms of the
    program counter value specified initially.

    .. seealso:: :func:`ud_set_pc`

.. c:function:: const char* ud_insn_hex(ud_t*)

    Returns pointer to a character string holding the hexadecimal
    representation of the disassembled bytes.

.. c:function:: const uint8_t* ud_insn_ptr(const ud_t* u)

    Returns pointer to the buffer holding the instruction bytes. Use
    :func:`ud_insn_len` to determine the size of this buffer.

.. c:function:: const char* ud_insn_asm(const ud_t* u)

    If the syntax is specified, returns pointer to the character string holding
    assembly language representation of the disassembled instruction.

.. c:function:: const ud_operand_t* ud_insn_opr(const ud_t* u, unsigned int n)

    Returns a reference (:type:`ud_operand_t`) to the nth (starting with 0)
    operand of the instruction. If the instruction does not have such an
    operand, the function returns :code:`NULL`.

.. c:function:: enum ud_mnemonic_code ud_insn_mnemonic(const ud_t *u)

    .. versionadded:: 1.7.2

    Returns the instruction mnemonic in the form of an enumerated constant
    (:code:`enum ud_mnemonic_code`). As a convention all mnemonic constants
    are composed by prefixing standard instruction mnemonics with :code:`UD_I`. 
    For example, the enumerations for :code:`mov`, :code:`xor` and :code:`jmp`
    are :code:`UD_Imov`, :code:`UD_Ixor`, and :code:`UD_Ijmp`, respectively.::

      ud_disassemble(&ud_obj);

      switch (ud_insn_mnemonic(ud_obj)) {
        case UD_Imov:  printf("mov!"); break;
        case UD_Ixor:  printf("xor!"); break;
        case UD_Ijmp:  printf("jmp!"); break;
        /*...*/
      }

    Prior to version 1.7.2, the way to access the mnemonic was by a field of
    :code:`ud_t`, :c:member:`ud_t.mnemonc`. This field is now deprecated and
    may not be supported in the future.

    .. seealso:: :func:`ud_lookup_mnemonic`

.. c:function:: const char* ud_const lookup_mnemonic(enum ud_mnemonic_code)

    Returns a pointer to a character string corresponding to the given
    mnemonic code. Returns a :code:`NULL` if the code is invalid.

Inspect Operands

form of :type:`ud_operand_t`. You can retrieve the nth operand of a
disassembled instruction using the function :func:`ud_insn_opr`.

1.1 Building and Installing udis86
==================================

udis86 is developed for unix-like environments, and like most software,
the basic steps towards building and installing it are as follows.

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

Depending on your choice of install location, you may need to have root
privileges to do an install. The install scripts copy the necessary
header and library files to appropriate locations in your system.

1.2 Interfacing with libudis86: A Quick Example
===============================================

The following is an example of a program that interfaces with libudis86
and uses the API to generate assembly language output for 64-bit code,
input from STDIN.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <udis86.h>

    int main()
    {
        ud_t ud_obj;

        ud_init(&ud_obj);
        ud_set_input_file(&ud_obj, stdin);
        ud_set_mode(&ud_obj, 64);
        ud_set_syntax(&ud_obj, UD_SYN_INTEL);

        while (ud_disassemble(&ud_obj)) {
            printf("\t%s\n", ud_insn_asm(&ud_obj));
        }

2 libudis86
***********

libudis86 is a disassembler library for the x86 architecture, including
support for the newer 64bit variants (IA32e, amd64, etc.) It provides
you the ability to decode a stream of bytes as x86 instructions,
inspect various bits of information about those instructions and even
translate to human readable assembly language format.

2.1 ud_t: udis86 object
=======================

libudis86 is reentrant, and to maintain that property it does not use
static data. All data related to the disassembly are stored in a single
object, called the udis86 object *note ud_t: 8.

 -- C Type: ud_t
     A structure encapsulating udis86 disassembler state.

  To use libudis86 you must create an instance of this object,

    ud_t ud_obj;

and initialize it,

    ud_init(&ud_obj);

You can create multiple such objects and use with the library, each one
an independent disassembler.

2.2 Setup Machine State
=======================

The decode semantics of a sequence of bytes depends on the target
machine state for which they are being disassembled. In x86, this means
the current effective processor mode (16, 32 or 64bits), the current
program counter (ip/eip/rip), and sometimes, the processor vendor. By
default, libudis86 is initialized to be in 32 bit disassembly mode,
program counter at 0, and vendor being `UD_VENDOR_ANY'.  The following
functions allow you to override these default to suit your needs.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_mode (ud_t*, uint8_t mode_bits)
     Sets the mode of disassembly. Possible values are 16, 32, and 64.
     By default, the library works in 32bit mode.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_pc (ud_t*, uint64_t pc)
     Sets the program counter (IP/EIP/RIP). This changes the offset of
     the assembly output generated, with direct effect on branch
     instructions.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_vendor (ud_t*, unsigned vendor)
     Sets the vendor of whose instruction to choose from. This is only
     useful for selecting the VMX or SVM instruction sets at which
     point INTEL and AMD have diverged significantly. At a later stage,
     support for a more granular selection of instruction sets maybe
     added.

        * `UD_VENDOR_INTEL' - for INTEL instruction set.

        * `UD_VENDOR_ATT' - for AMD instruction set.

        * `UD_VENDOR_ANY' - for any valid instruction in either INTEL
          or AMD.

2.3 Setup Input
===============

libudis86 provides three ways in which you can input binary data: as a
fixed sized memory buffer, a standard library FILE object, or as a
callback function.  By default, a *note ud_t: 8. object is initialized
to read input from `STDIN'.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_input_buffer (ud_t*, unsigned char* buffer,
          size_t size)
     Sets the input source for the library to a `buffer' of `size'
     bytes.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_input_file (ud_t*, FILE* filep)
     Sets the input source to a file pointed to by a given standard
     library `FILE' pointer. Note that libudis86 does not perform any
     checks, and assumes that the file pointer is properly initialized
     and open for reading.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_input_hook (ud_t* ud_obj, int
          (*hook)(ud_t *ud_obj))
     Sets a pointer to a function, to callback for input. The callback
     is invoked each time libudis86 needs the next byte in the input
     stream. To single end-of-input, this callback must return the
     constant `UD_EOI'.

See also
........

     *note ud_set_user_opaque_data(): 11, *note
ud_set_user_opaque_data(): 11.

 -- C Function: void ud_input_skip(ud_t*, size_t n);
     Skips ahead `n' number of bytes in the input stream.

 -- C Function: int ud_input_end(const ud_t*);
     Test for end of input. You can use this function to test if udis86
     has exhausted the input.

  At the end of input, udis86 stops disassembly. If you want to restart
or reset the source of input, you must again invoke one of the above
functions.

  Sometimes you may want to associate custom data with a udis86 object,
that you can use with the input callback function, or even in different
parts of your own project as you pass the object around. You can use
the following two functions to achieve this.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_user_opaque_data (ud_t* ud_obj,
          void* opaque)
     Associates a pointer with the udis86 object to be retrieved and
     used in client functions, such as the input hook callback function.

 -- C Function: void* ud_get_user_opaque_data (const ud_t* ud_obj)
     Returns any pointer associated with the udis86 object, using the
     *note ud_set_user_opaque_data(): 11. function.


File: udis86.info,  Node: Setup Translation,  Next: Disassemble,  Prev: Setup Input,  Up: libudis86

2.4 Setup Translation
=====================

libudis86 can translate the decoded instruction into one of two assembly
language dialects: the INTEL syntax (such as those found in NASM and
YASM) and the other which resembles GNU Assembler (AT&T style) syntax.
By default, this is set to INTEL like syntax. You can override the
default or specify your own translator using the following function.

 -- C Function: void ud_set_syntax (ud_t*, void (*translator)(ud_t*))
     Sets the function that translates the intermediate decode
     information to a human readable form. There are two inbuilt
     translators,

        - `UD_SYN_INTEL' for INTEL (NASM-like) syntax. (default)

        - `UD_SYN_ATT' for AT&T (GAS-like) syntax.

     If you do not want libudis86 to translate, you can pass `NULL' to
     the function, with no more translations thereafter. This is useful
     when you only want to identify chunks of code and then create the
     assembly output if needed, or when you are only interested in
     examining the instructions and do not want to waste cycles
     generating the assembly language output.

     If you want to create your own translator, you can specify a
     pointer to your own function. This function must accept a single
     parameter, the udis86 object *note ud_t: 8, and it will be invoked
     everytime an instruction is decoded.


File: udis86.info,  Node: Disassemble,  Next: Inspect Operands,  Prev: Setup Translation,  Up: libudis86

2.5 Disassemble
===============

With target state and input source set up, you can now disassemble. At
the core of libudis86 api is the function *note ud_disassemble(): 16.
which does this.  libudis86 exposes decoded instructions in an
intermediate form meant to be useful for programs that want to examine
them. This intermediate form is available using functions and fields of
*note ud_t: 8. as described below.

 -- C Function: unsigned int ud_disassemble (ud_t*)
     Disassembles the next instruction in the input stream.

          Returns: the number of bytes disassembled. A 0 indicates end
          of input.

     Note, to restart disassembly after the end of input, you must call
     one of the input setting functions with a new source of input.

     A common use-case pattern for this function is in a loop:

         while (ud_disassemble(&ud_obj)) {
             /*
              * use or print decode info.
              */
         }



  For each successful invocation of *note ud_disassemble(): 16, you can
use the following functions to get information about the disassembled
instruction.

 -- C Function: unsigned int ud_insn_len (const ud_t* u)
     Returns the number of bytes disassembled.

 -- C Function: uint64_t ud_insn_off (const ud_t*)
     Returns the offset of the disassembled instruction in terms of the
     program counter value specified initially.

See also
........

     *note ud_set_pc(): b.

 -- C Function: const char* ud_insn_hex (ud_t*)
     Returns pointer to a character string holding the hexadecimal
     representation of the disassembled bytes.

 -- C Function: const uint8_t* ud_insn_ptr (const ud_t* u)
     Returns pointer to the buffer holding the instruction bytes. Use
     *note ud_insn_len(): 17. to determine the size of this buffer.

 -- C Function: const char* ud_insn_asm (const ud_t* u)
     If the syntax is specified, returns pointer to the character
     string holding assembly language representation of the
     disassembled instruction.

 -- C Function: const ud_operand_t* ud_insn_opr (const ud_t* u,
          unsigned int n)
     Returns a reference (*note ud_operand_t: 1d.) to the nth (starting
     with 0) operand of the instruction. If the instruction does not
     have such an operand, the function returns `NULL'.

 -- C Function: enum ud_mnemonic_code ud_insn_mnemonic (const ud_t *u)
     New in version 1.7.2.

     Returns the instruction mnemonic in the form of an enumerated
     constant (`enum ud_mnemonic_code'). As a convention all mnemonic
     constants are composed by prefixing standard instruction mnemonics
     with `UD_I'.  For example, the enumerations for `mov', `xor' and
     `jmp' are `UD_Imov', `UD_Ixor', and `UD_Ijmp', respectively.:

         ud_disassemble(&ud_obj);

         switch (ud_insn_mnemonic(ud_obj)) {
           case UD_Imov:  printf("mov!"); break;
           case UD_Ixor:  printf("xor!"); break;
           case UD_Ijmp:  printf("jmp!"); break;
           /*...*/
         }

     Prior to version 1.7.2, the way to access the mnemonic was by a
     field of `ud_t', `ud_t.mnemonc'. This field is now deprecated and
     may not be supported in the future.

     `ud_lookup_mnemonic()'

 -- C Function: const char* ud_const lookup_mnemonic
          (enum ud_mnemonic_code)
     Returns a pointer to a character string corresponding to the given
     mnemonic code. Returns a `NULL' if the code is invalid.

# ===========================================================================
#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_COMPARE_VERSION(VERSION_A, OP, VERSION_B, [ACTION-IF-TRUE], [ACTION-IF-FALSE])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro compares two version strings. Due to the various number of
#   minor-version numbers that can exist, and the fact that string
#   comparisons are not compatible with numeric comparisons, this is not
#   necessarily trivial to do in a autoconf script. This macro makes doing
#   these comparisons easy.
#
#   The six basic comparisons are available, as well as checking equality
#   limited to a certain number of minor-version levels.
#
#   The operator OP determines what type of comparison to do, and can be one
#   of:
#
#    eq  - equal (test A == B)
#    ne  - not equal (test A != B)
#    le  - less than or equal (test A <= B)
#    ge  - greater than or equal (test A >= B)
#    lt  - less than (test A < B)
#    gt  - greater than (test A > B)
#
#   Additionally, the eq and ne operator can have a number after it to limit
#   the test to that number of minor versions.
#
#    eq0 - equal up to the length of the shorter version
#    ne0 - not equal up to the length of the shorter version
#    eqN - equal up to N sub-version levels
#    neN - not equal up to N sub-version levels
#
#   When the condition is true, shell commands ACTION-IF-TRUE are run,
#   otherwise shell commands ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. The environment
#   variable 'ax_compare_version' is always set to either 'true' or 'false'
#   as well.
#
#   Examples:
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[lt],[3.15.8])
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15],[lt],[3.15.8])
#
#   would both be true.
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq],[3.15.8])
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15],[gt],[3.15.8])
#
#   would both be false.
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq2],[3.15.8])
#
#   would be true because it is only comparing two minor versions.
#
#     AX_COMPARE_VERSION([3.15.7],[eq0],[3.15])
#
#   would be true because it is only comparing the lesser number of minor
#   versions of the two values.
#
#   Note: The characters that separate the version numbers do not matter. An
#   empty string is the same as version 0. OP is evaluated by autoconf, not
#   configure, so must be a string, not a variable.
#
#   The author would like to acknowledge Guido Draheim whose advice about
#   the m4_case and m4_ifvaln functions make this macro only include the
#   portions necessary to perform the specific comparison specified by the
#   OP argument in the final configure script.

#   AX_PROG_YASM_VERSION([VERSION],[ACTION-IF-TRUE],[ACTION-IF-FALSE])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Makes sure that yasm supports the version indicated. If true 
#   the shell commands in ACTION-IF-TRUE are executed. If not the shell
#   commands in ACTION-IF-FALSE are run. Note if $YASM is not set
#   (for example by running AX_WITH_PROG) the macro will fail.
#
#   Example:
#
#     AX_WITH_PROG(YASM,yasm)
#     AX_PROG_YASM_VERSION([1.1.1],[ ... ],[ ... ])

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_WITH_PROG([VARIABLE],[program],[VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND],[PATH])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Locates an installed program binary, placing the result in the precious
#   variable VARIABLE. Accepts a present VARIABLE, then --with-program, and
#   failing that searches for program in the given path (which defaults to
#   the system path). If program is found, VARIABLE is set to the full path
#   of the binary; if it is not found VARIABLE is set to VALUE-IF-NOT-FOUND
#   if provided, unchanged otherwise.
#
#   A typical example could be the following one:
#
#         AX_WITH_PROG(PERL,perl)
#
#   NOTE: This macro is based upon the original AX_WITH_PYTHON macro from
#   Dustin J. Mitchell <dustin@cs.uchicago.edu>.
