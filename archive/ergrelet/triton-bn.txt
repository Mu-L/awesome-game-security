      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# triton-bn ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Binary_Ninja_API-v4.0.x-blue)

`triton-bn` is a small Binary Ninja plugin that can be used to apply
[Triton](https://github.com/jonathansalwan/Triton)'s dead store eliminitation
pass on basic blocks or functions.  
The plugin supports the `x86_64`, `x86` and `aarch64` architectures.

This plugin may also serve as a base for people that would want to play with
Triton inside of Binary Ninja.

## How to Build

On Windows:
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/ergrelet/triton-bn.git && cd triton-bn
$ ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
$ cmake --build build --config Release -- -maxcpucount
```

On Linux distributions:
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/ergrelet/triton-bn.git && cd triton-bn
$ ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
$ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
$ cmake --build build -- -j$(nproc)
```

## How to Install

Check out the official Binary Ninja documentation to know where to copy the
files:
[Using Plugins](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/plugins.html)


## Know Limitations
* Instructions  that use RIP/PC-relative addressing aren't relocated properly in preview mode
