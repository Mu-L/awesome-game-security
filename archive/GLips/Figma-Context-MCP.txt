# Framelink MCP for Figma

Framelink MCP for Figma is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives AI coding tools (Cursor, etc.) access to Figma design data. It fetches Figma files/nodes via the Figma API, simplifies the response to include only relevant layout and styling information, and serves it to AI clients.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm build            # Build with tsup (outputs to dist/)
pnpm dev              # Development mode with watch + auto-restart (HTTP)
pnpm dev:cli          # Development mode (stdio)
pnpm test             # Run Vitest tests
pnpm type-check       # TypeScript type checking only
pnpm lint             # ESLint
pnpm format           # Prettier formatting
pnpm inspect          # Run MCP inspector for debugging
```

### Running the Server

```bash
pnpm start            # HTTP mode (default port 3333)
pnpm start:cli        # stdio mode for MCP clients
```

### Running a Single Test

```bash
pnpm test -- path/to/test.ts
pnpm test -- --testNamePattern="pattern"
```

### Releasing

Releases are automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). On merge to `main`, release-please reads conventional commit prefixes (`fix:`, `feat:`, `feat!:`) and maintains a release PR. Merging the release PR publishes to npm via OIDC trusted publishing.

### PR Title Convention

PRs are squash-merged, so the PR title becomes the commit message that release-please parses. Always use [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefixes in PR titles.

## Architecture

### Entry Points

- `src/bin.ts` — CLI entry point, calls `startServer()`
- `src/server.ts` — Server initialization, handles stdio vs HTTP mode selection
- `src/mcp-server.ts` — Library re-exports for external consumers (`createServer`, `startServer`, etc.)
- `src/index.ts` — Library exports (extractors, types)

### Transport Modes

The server supports three transports (all configured in `src/server.ts`):

- **stdio** — For direct MCP client integration (activated with `--stdio` flag or `NODE_ENV=cli`)
- **StreamableHTTP** — Modern HTTP transport at `/mcp`
- **SSE** — Legacy HTTP transport at `/sse` + `/messages`

### Core Data Flow

1. **MCP Tools** (`src/mcp/tools/`) — Define tool schemas and handlers

   - `get_figma_data` — Fetches and simplifies Figma design data
   - `download_figma_images` — Downloads images from Figma

2. **Figma Service** (`src/services/figma.ts`) — API client for Figma REST API

   - Handles auth (Personal Access Token or OAuth)
   - Methods: `getRawFile()`, `getRawNode()`, `downloadImages()`

3. **Extractor System** (`src/extractors/`) — Transforms raw Figma API responses

   - `design-extractor.ts` — Entry point, parses API response and calls extractors
   - `node-walker.ts` — Recursive traversal applying extractors to each node
   - `built-in.ts` — Built-in extractors: `layoutExtractor`, `textExtractor`, `visualsExtractor`, `componentExtractor`
   - Extractors are composable; `allExtractors` combines all built-ins

4. **Transformers** (`src/transformers/`) — Convert specific Figma properties
   - `layout.ts` — Layout/positioning transforms
   - `style.ts` — Visual styling (fills, strokes)
   - `effects.ts` — Effects (shadows, blurs)
   - `text.ts` — Text content and styling
   - `component.ts` — Component metadata

### Configuration

`src/config.ts` handles CLI args and environment variables:

- `FIGMA_API_KEY` or `--figma-api-key` — Personal Access Token
- `FIGMA_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `--figma-oauth-token` — OAuth Bearer token
- `PORT` or `--port` — HTTP server port (default: 3333)
- `--json` — Output JSON instead of YAML
- `--skip-image-downloads` — Disable image download tool

### Path Alias

The codebase uses `~/` as an alias for `src/` (configured in tsconfig.json and vitest.config.ts).

## Philosophy

From CONTRIBUTING.md — important context for development:

1. **Unix Philosophy** — Tools should have one job and few arguments. Keep tools simple to avoid confusing LLMs.
2. **Focused Scope** — The server only handles "ingesting designs for AI consumption." Out of scope: image manipulation, CMS syncing, code generation, third-party integrations.
3. **Project-level Config** — Options unlikely to change between requests should be CLI arguments, not tool parameters.

## Quality

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.

For each proposed change, examine the existing system and redesign it into the most elegant solution that would have emerged if the change had been a foundational assumption from the start.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

## Comment Policy

### Unacceptable Comments

- Comments that repeat what code does
- Commented-out code (delete it)
- Obvious comments ("increment counter")
- Comments instead of good naming

### Great Comments

- **Why this exists** — what problem does this solve, why is it valuable
- **Why it works this way** — important design decisions and their rationale
- **Why NOT** — approaches you considered and rejected, to prevent re-attempting failed ideas
- **Warnings** — non-obvious gotchas, ordering dependencies, "this must happen before X"
- **Domain bridges** — when code implements complex domain logic (finance calculations, protocol specs, algorithms) that can't fully express the underlying concept
- **Looks wrong** — when code appears unused, redundant, or incorrect but exists for a non-obvious reason (e.g., interface contracts for test implementations, load-bearing side effects)
- **Negative space** — when code deliberately doesn't handle something and that absence is intentional (e.g., "Does not retry—caller handles backoff" prevents someone from "helpfully" adding retry logic that breaks upstream assumptions)

## Testing Philosophy

Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.

- Every test has a cost: maintenance, false positives, slower CI. Tests must earn their place.
- Most features need 2-5 tests. Some need zero.
- Zero tests is valid for: simple CRUD, styling, config changes, framework-convention code, etc.
- Design for testability using "functional core, imperative shell": keep pure business logic separate from code that does IO.

### Principles

- **Test behavior, not implementation.** Tests should verify what the code does, not how it does it. Only use methods available on the public interface to verify behavior.
- **Don't test what the type system guarantees.** If TypeScript enforces it at compile time, a runtime test adds no value.
- **Don't test the framework.** Don't verify that Express routes, React renders, or ORM queries work — test _your_ logic.
- **Prefer real implementations over mocks.** Mocks couple tests to implementation details and hide real bugs. Only mock at system boundaries (network, filesystem, time).

### Only test behavior where:

- A failure would frustrate or block real users
- The behavior is non-obvious and could regress silently
- It's a critical integration point or state transition

### Skip testing:

- Implementation details, private methods, trivial code
- Edge cases that won't occur in practice
- Variations that test the same underlying behavior

## Error Handling

Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries — user input, external APIs, file I/O. Don't add try/catch, fallbacks, or defensive checks for scenarios that can't happen in practice. Let errors propagate naturally; the caller that knows how to handle them should be the one catching them.

## External Libraries

Use the context7 MCP first to gather information on unfamiliar libraries or APIs. If that fails, you may search the code directly or search the web for more detail.

## Communication Style

When reviewing plans, providing feedback, or analyzing approaches, be genuinely critical. Flag real risks, tradeoffs, and things that will break rather than being agreeable. Grounded, opinionated analysis is more valuable than polite agreement.

# Contributing to Framelink MCP for Figma

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Framelink MCP for Figma! This guide will help you get started with contributing to this project.

## Philosophy

### Unix Philosophy for Tools

This project adheres to the Unix philosophy: tools should have one job and few arguments. We keep our tools as simple as possible to avoid confusing LLMs during calling. Configurable options that are more project-level (i.e., unlikely to change between requests for Figma data) are best set as command line arguments rather than being exposed as tool parameters.

### MCP Server Scope

The MCP server should only focus on **ingesting designs for AI consumption**. This is our core responsibility and what we do best. Additional features are best handled externally by other specialized tools. Examples of features that would be out of scope include:

- Image conversion, cropping, or other image manipulation
- Syncing design data to CMSes or databases
- Code generation or framework-specific output
- Third-party integrations unrelated to design ingestion

This focused approach ensures:

- Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Better maintainability
- Easier testing and debugging
- More reliable integration with AI tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- pnpm (recommended package manager)
- A Figma API access token ([how to create one](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens))

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP.git
   cd Figma-Context-MCP
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
   FIGMA_API_KEY=your_figma_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Build the project:**

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

5. **Run tests:**

   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

6. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

7. **Test locally:**

   `pnpm dev` will start a local server you can connect to via Streamable HTTP. To connect to it, you can add the following configuration to your MCP JSON config file. Note, some MCP clients use a different format. [See the Framelink docs](https://www.framelink.ai/docs/quickstart#configure-ide) for more information on specific clients.

   ```bash
   "mcpServers": {
      "Framelink MCP for Figma - Local StreamableHTTP": {
         "url": "http://localhost:3333/mcp"
      },
   }
   ```

### Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with watch mode
- `pnpm build` - Build the project
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm inspect` - Run MCP inspector for debugging

## Code Style and Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code

- `fix: <description>` — patch release (0.6.4 → 0.6.5)
- `feat: <description>` — minor release (0.6.4 → 0.7.0)
- `feat!: <description>` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer — major release (0.6.4 → 1.0.0)
- `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:` — no release triggered

### What We're Looking For

- **New features** - Expand the server's capabilities to support more Figma features
- **Bug fixes** - Help us improve reliability
- **Performance improvements** - Make the server faster
- **Documentation improvements** - Help others understand the project
- **Test coverage** - Improve our test suite
- **Code quality** - Refactoring and clean-up

### What We're Not Looking For

Give [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) and other AI-powered coding tools access to your Figma files with this [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server.

When Cursor has access to Figma design data, it's **way** better at one-shotting designs accurately than alternative approaches like pasting screenshots.

<h3><a href="https://www.framelink.ai/docs/quickstart?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme">See quickstart instructions →</a></h3>

## Demo

[Watch a demo of building a UI in Cursor with Figma design data](https://youtu.be/6G9yb-LrEqg)

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6G9yb-LrEqg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6G9yb-LrEqg)

## How it works

1. Open your IDE's chat (e.g. agent mode in Cursor).
2. Paste a link to a Figma file, frame, or group.
3. Ask Cursor to do something with the Figma file—e.g. implement the design.
4. Cursor will fetch the relevant metadata from Figma and use it to write your code.

This MCP server is specifically designed for use with Cursor. Before responding with context from the [Figma API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api), it simplifies and translates the response so only the most relevant layout and styling information is provided to the model.

Reducing the amount of context provided to the model helps make the AI more accurate and the responses more relevant.

## Getting Started

Many code editors and other AI clients use a configuration file to manage MCP servers.

The `figma-developer-mcp` server can be configured by adding the following to your configuration file.

> NOTE: You will need to create a Figma access token to use this server. Instructions on how to create a Figma API access token can be found [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens).

### MacOS / Linux

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink MCP for Figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Framelink MCP for Figma": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or you can set `FIGMA_API_KEY` and `PORT` in the `env` field.

If you need more information on how to configure the Framelink MCP for Figma, see the [Framelink docs](https://www.framelink.ai/docs/quickstart?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).

# Figma MCP Server Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned improvements and features for the Figma MCP Server project. Items are organized by development phases and effort levels.

## Overview

The Figma MCP Server enables AI coding assistants to access Figma design data directly, improving the accuracy of design-to-code translations. This roadmap focuses on expanding capabilities, improving developer experience, and ensuring robust enterprise support.

## Core Feature Enhancements 🚀

_High impact, foundational improvements_

### Component & Prototype Support (High Priority)

- [ ] **Add dedicated tool for component extraction** ([#124](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP/issues/124))
  - [ ] Create `get_figma_components` tool for fetching full component/component set design data including variants and properties
- [ ] **Improve INSTANCE support**
  - [ ] Return only overridden values
  - [ ] Hide children of INSTANCE except for slot type children or if full data is explicitly requested via new tool call parameter
- [ ] **Prototype support**
  - [ ] Extract interactivity data (e.g. actions on hover, click, etc.)
  - [ ] Return data on animations / transitions
  - [?] State management hints

### Parsing Logic

- [ ] Inline variables that only show up once, and keep global vars only for variables that are reused

### Image & Asset Handling

- [ ] **Fix masked / cropped image exports**
  - [ ] Correctly export cropped images ([#162](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP/issues/162))
  - [?] Support complex mask shapes and transformations
  - [?] Pull image fills/vectors out to top level for better AI visibility
- [ ] **Improve SVG handling**
  - [ ] Better icon identification, e.g. if all components of a frame are VECTOR, download the full frame as an SVG
  - [?] Add support for raw path data in response—not sure if this is valuable yet

### Layout Improvements

- [ ] **Smart wrapped layout detection**
  - [?] Detect and convert fixed-width children to percentage-based widths
  - [ ] Better flexbox wrap support
  - [ ] Grid layout detection for wrapped items
  - [ ] Support for Figma's new grid layout

### Advanced Styling

- [ ] **Enhanced gradient support**
  - [ ] Make sure gradients are exported correctly in CSS syntax ([#152](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP/issues/152))
- [ ] **Grid system support**
  - [ ] Support for Figma's new grid autolayout (an addition to the long-existing flex autolayout)
  - [ ] Legacy "layout guide" grids
- [ ] **Named styles extraction**
  - [ ] Export style names associated with different layouts, colors, text, etc. for easier identification by the LLM (can use `/v1/styles/:key` endpoint)

### Text & Typography

- [ ] **Text styling**
  - [ ] Add support for formatted text in text fields ([#159](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP/issues/159))
  - [ ] Add support for mixed text styles (e.g. multiple colors) ([#140](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP/issues/140))

## Enterprise & Advanced Features 🏢

_Features for scaling and enterprise adoption_

### Enterprise Support

- [ ] **Variable System Enhancements**
  - [ ] Port `deduceVariablesFromTokens` for non-Enterprise users (see [tothienbao6a0's fork](https://github.com/tothienbao6a0/Figma-Context-MCP/blob/d9b035de76f44c952382b8155a5d5bf938e52a77/src/services/variable-deduction.ts#L30) for inspiration?)
  - [ ] Add `getFigmaVariables` for Enterprise plans
  - [?] Export design tokens in standard formats

## Developer Experience 🛠️

_Improving usability and integration_

### Performance & Reliability

- [ ] **Better error handling**
  - [x] Retry logic for API failures
  - [ ] Detailed error messages which the LLM can expand on for users

### Documentation & Testing

- [ ] **Test coverage improvements**
  - [ ] Unit tests for all transformers
  - [ ] Integration tests with mock Figma API
  - [ ] E2E tests to visually check the implementation of an LLM coding agent prompted with MCP server output—likely uses a custom test framework to kick off e.g. Claude Code in the background

## Quick Wins 🎪

_Low effort, high impact_

- [ ] Better handling of text overflow (e.g. auto width, auto height, fixed width + truncate text setting)
- [ ] Double check to make sure blend modes are forwarded properly in the simplified response

## Technical Debt 🧹

_Code quality and maintenance_

- [ ] Clean up image download code (noted in mcp.ts)
- [ ] Refactor `convertAlign` function (layout.ts)
- [ ] Standardize error handling across services

## Research & Exploration 🔬

_Investigate feasibility / value_

- [ ] Figma plugin companion 🚀🚀🚀
- [ ] **Design System Integration**
  - [ ] Token extraction and mapping
  - [ ] Component dependency graphs
- [ ] **Figma File Metadata**
  - [ ] Investigate how we can use frames that are marked "Ready for Dev"
  - [ ] Investigate feasibility of pulling in annotations via the Figma API
  - [ ] Investigate feasibility/value of using—and even modifying—"Dev Resources" links via Figma API

# Flexible Figma Data Extractors

This module provides a flexible, single-pass system for extracting data from Figma design files. It allows you to compose different extractors based on your specific needs, making it perfect for different LLM use cases where you want to optimize context window usage.

## Architecture

The system is built in clean layers:

1. **Strategy Layer**: Define what you want to extract
2. **Traversal Layer**: Single-pass tree walking with configurable extractors
3. **Extraction Layer**: Pure functions that transform individual node data

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { extractFromDesign, allExtractors, layoutAndText, contentOnly } from "figma-mcp/extractors";

// Extract everything (equivalent to current parseNode)
const fullData = extractFromDesign(nodes, allExtractors);

// Extract only layout + text for content planning
const layoutData = extractFromDesign(nodes, layoutAndText, {
  maxDepth: 3,
});

// Extract only text content for copy audits
const textData = extractFromDesign(nodes, contentOnly, {
  nodeFilter: (node) => node.type === "TEXT",
});
```

## Built-in Extractors

### Individual Extractors

- `layoutExtractor` - Layout properties (positioning, sizing, flex properties)
- `textExtractor` - Text content and typography styles
- `visualsExtractor` - Visual appearance (fills, strokes, effects, opacity, borders)
- `componentExtractor` - Component instance data

### Convenience Combinations

- `allExtractors` - Everything (replicates current behavior)
- `layoutAndText` - Layout + text (good for content analysis)
- `contentOnly` - Text only (good for copy extraction)
- `visualsOnly` - Visual styles only (good for design systems)
- `layoutOnly` - Layout only (good for structure analysis)

## Creating Custom Extractors

```typescript
import type { ExtractorFn } from "figma-mcp/extractors";

// Custom extractor that identifies design system components
const designSystemExtractor: ExtractorFn = (node, result, context) => {
  if (node.name.startsWith("DS/")) {
    result.isDesignSystemComponent = true;
    result.dsCategory = node.name.split("/")[1];
  }
};

// Use it with other extractors
const data = extractFromDesign(nodes, [layoutExtractor, designSystemExtractor]);
```

## Filtering and Options

```typescript
// Limit traversal depth
const shallowData = extractFromDesign(nodes, allExtractors, {
  maxDepth: 2,
});

// Filter to specific node types
const frameData = extractFromDesign(nodes, layoutAndText, {
  nodeFilter: (node) => ["FRAME", "GROUP"].includes(node.type),
});

// Custom filtering logic
const buttonData = extractFromDesign(nodes, allExtractors, {
  nodeFilter: (node) => node.name.toLowerCase().includes("button"),
});
```

## LLM Context Optimization

The flexible system is designed for different LLM use cases:

```typescript
// For large designs - extract incrementally
function extractForLLM(nodes, phase) {
  switch (phase) {
    case "structure":
      return extractFromDesign(nodes, layoutOnly, { maxDepth: 3 });

    case "content":
      return extractFromDesign(nodes, contentOnly);

    case "styling":
      return extractFromDesign(nodes, visualsOnly, { maxDepth: 2 });

    case "full":
      return extractFromDesign(nodes, allExtractors);
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Tree Walk** - Efficient processing, no matter how many extractors
2. **Composable** - Mix and match extractors for your specific needs
3. **Extensible** - Easy to add custom extractors for domain-specific logic
4. **Type Safe** - Full TypeScript support with proper inference
5. **Context Optimized** - Perfect for LLM context window management
6. **Backward Compatible** - Works alongside existing parsing logic

## Migration Path

The new system works alongside the current `parseNode` function. You can:

1. Start using the new extractors for new use cases
2. Gradually migrate existing functionality
3. Keep the current API for general-purpose parsing

The `allExtractors` combination provides equivalent functionality to the current `parseNode` behavior.
