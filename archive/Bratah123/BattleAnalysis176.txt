# BattleAnalysis176
A C++ Console Program that calculates some in games stats after a certain time.

## Goals
- This Programs goal is to simulate Maplestory's Battle Analysis but in Maplestory v176
  - It uses pointers and offsets to read the client's in game stats and after a certain time interval calculates how much mesos and nx you'd make in an hour.
- Intended use is for v176 Private Servers, but might add more memory addresses for different versions.

## Installation
- Go into battle_analysis.cpp and change the Window Name to match your Maplestory Window Name.
- Using any C++ compiler, compile the file which will output an exe.
- Make sure to run the exe as admin for it to work.
- Then farm and type anything and press enter in console for it to tell you how much you make!
