This project is an IDA Pro plugin that replaces and extends the default IDAPython scripting namespace. It reorganizes disassembler APIs into a simpler Python interface and adds capabilities such as tagging, filtering, and streamlined database and function automation. The repository includes installation guidance, modular abstractions, and documentation for building rapid reverse-engineering scripts. It is primarily used by reverse engineers who want faster annotation, navigation, and analysis workflows.
