This project is a technical write-up and proof-of-concept exploit for Mali GPU kernel vulnerabilities on modern Android Pixel devices. It describes a vulnerability chain that combines integer-overflow-related logic flaws and information leakage to obtain arbitrary kernel memory access. The implementation uses C/C++ code and low-level kernel interface headers to demonstrate privilege escalation effects such as SELinux disablement and root access. It is intended for mobile security researchers studying Android kernel exploitation and GPU attack surfaces.
