This project is a kernel read/write exploit chain targeting Apple devices with Neural Engine support. It combines multiple vulnerabilities in ANE-related components and documents practical constraints, tested device ranges, and exploitation reliability notes. The repository mixes Objective-C, C, and C code with iOS app scaffolding and low-level IOKit and IOSurface interaction helpers. It is primarily aimed at iOS and macOS security researchers analyzing multi-stage kernel exploitation techniques.
