This project is an updated and consolidated Half-Life SDK for developing mods across Half-Life, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift.
It is primarily a large C++ codebase with CMake-based cross-platform build support for modern Visual Studio and GCC toolchains.
The repository integrates many bug fixes, refactors shared systems to reduce duplication, and provides extensive documentation, tooling, and changelogs for mod developers.
It is intended for game development and engine-level research rather than cheating, making it valuable for understanding classic FPS code architecture and secure modding workflows.
