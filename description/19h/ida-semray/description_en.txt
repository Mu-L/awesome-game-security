This project is an AI-assisted IDA Pro plugin for semantic binary analysis.
It uses a Gemini-powered workflow to suggest function names, variable names, and detailed comments from decompiled code or assembly context.
The implementation is in Python and provides an interactive interface with context-aware analysis across callers, callees, and references.
Its main use case is accelerating reverse engineering triage and code comprehension for security analysts.
