This project is a C++ example of hooking Steam's overlay process to draw custom UI elements. It demonstrates intercepting PaintTraverse calls in the VGUI pipeline and using shared memory to communicate render data. The sample also implements fallback shape drawing logic and documents practical constraints of overlay rendering. It is primarily useful for overlay-hook research in game security and anti-cheat related experimentation.
