kdmapper-1909 is a Windows kernel driver mapper tailored for build versions 1809, 1903, and 1909. The C++ code loads a vulnerable Intel driver interface and uses it to perform privileged kernel memory operations. It includes manual mapping routines, PE parsing helpers, and service management logic to deploy unsigned drivers from user mode. The project is primarily used for Windows kernel security research, low-level driver experimentation, and anti-cheat bypass studies.
