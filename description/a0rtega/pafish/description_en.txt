This project is an open-source anti-analysis testing tool that emulates detection techniques used by real malware. It is written in C and includes modules that check for virtual machines, sandboxes, debuggers, hooks, and environment artifacts across platforms such as VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, and Wine. The code is intended for reproducible testing and can be built with MinGW-w64 and make-based workflows. It is mainly used by security researchers to evaluate analysis environments and study evasion behavior.
