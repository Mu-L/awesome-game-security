This project is a proof of concept for collecting hardware identifiers directly from PCI and AHCI devices.
It brute-forces PCI enumeration and identifies storage-related controllers without relying on higher-level operating system APIs.
The goal is to reduce exposure to software hooks that may spoof or intercept conventional HWID queries.
It is primarily useful for anti-cheat and low-level platform security research, with an explicit experimental caveat.
