This project is a DLL-based UWP spying and hook toolkit for debugging and reverse engineering Windows Runtime applications. It is written in C++ and hooks selected UWP and WinRT interfaces while logging runtime behavior to a console. The code provides reusable low-level hook scaffolding and API interception patterns suitable for instrumentation tasks. Its primary audience is researchers investigating UWP internals and application behavior during execution.
