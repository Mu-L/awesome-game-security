This project is a command-line injector for launching UWP applications and injecting DLLs at a very early startup stage. It is implemented in C with Win32 and AppModel APIs and uses a debugger-like suspended launch flow to gain early process control. The repository includes build and environment scripts for Windows toolchains and a straightforward DLL drop-in workflow. Its main use case is UWP reverse engineering, runtime instrumentation, and debugging support.
