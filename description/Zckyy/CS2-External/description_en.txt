CS2-External is a Counter-Strike 2 external cheat project implemented in C#.
It emphasizes a read-only memory model with overlay drawing and includes helper modules for entities, offsets, view matrices, and runtime cheat logic.
The solution also contains authentication and subscription handling components alongside the core gameplay feature code.
Its intended use case is educational exploration of external game memory analysis and overlay-based tooling for CS2.
