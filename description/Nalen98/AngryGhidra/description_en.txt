This project is a Ghidra extension that embeds angr symbolic execution into interactive reverse engineering workflows.
It allows analysts to set start, find, and avoid addresses, launch symbolic exploration, and apply patched bytes back to analysis state.
The plugin uses Java for Ghidra integration and Python with angr and claripy for analysis automation.
It is intended for CTF solving, malware and binary research, and general software or game reverse engineering tasks.
