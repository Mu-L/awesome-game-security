This project is a desktop editor for Unity .assets and AssetBundle files across multiple engine versions. It is implemented mainly in C++ with a Win32-based interface, CMake build support, and a plugin architecture. Included plugins handle textures, text assets, audio clips, meshes, and raw resource data import and export to common formats such as PNG, WAV, OBJ, and DAE. Its primary use case is Unity modding, asset inspection, and game content research workflows.
