This project is a C++ library that impersonates Hyper-V behavior and intercepts selected hypercalls from the Windows kernel.
It exposes ready-to-hook implementations for low-level paths such as TLB flushing, sleep and shutdown handling, address-space switching, and spinlock behavior.
The codebase focuses on virtualization internals, kernel compatibility constraints, and integration as a reusable library component.
It is aimed at advanced kernel and anti-cheat researchers exploring hypervisor-layer interception and stealth techniques.
