This project is a proof-of-concept for creating hidden or shadowed memory regions in Windows processes.
It is written in C++ and demonstrates guarded-region style techniques tied to context-switch behavior and low-level memory semantics.
The repository includes demo-oriented code and media that illustrate how hidden regions can behave under runtime inspection.
It is primarily intended for reverse engineering and anti-cheat bypass research rather than production deployment.
