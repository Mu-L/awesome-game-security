This project is a customized World of Warcraft 5.4.7 private-server source tree derived from TrinityCore-style architecture.
It is largely written in C and C++ with CMake build scripts, auth and world server components, and supporting database and tooling resources.
The included notes emphasize gameplay fixes, class and talent support, and general stability improvements for a level-90 era server setup.
It is intended for private-server developers and reverse-engineering communities working on MMO server emulation.
