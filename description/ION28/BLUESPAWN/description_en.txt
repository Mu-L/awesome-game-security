BLUESPAWN is an open-source Windows active defense and endpoint detection and response platform. It provides Hunt, Mitigate, Monitor, and Scan workflows with ATT&CK-oriented detections, YARA scanning, ETW-based monitoring, and automated response actions such as quarantine or process suspension. The implementation is largely in C++ with deep Windows API integration and rule-driven detection content. It is designed for blue-team operators and security researchers defending enterprise endpoints.
