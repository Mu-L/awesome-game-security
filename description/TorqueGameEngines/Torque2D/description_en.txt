This project is an open-source cross-platform 2D game engine. It is primarily C++ based and ships with a broad engine stack including rendering, Box2D physics, audio systems, animation support, and modular project tooling. The codebase targets Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and web-related workflows, and includes sample modules for learning and rapid iteration. Its main use case is building and customizing full 2D games with source-level control.
