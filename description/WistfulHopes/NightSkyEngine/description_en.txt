This project is a free and open-source fighting game framework built with Unreal Engine 5 for 2D and 2.5D titles.
Its implementation is primarily C++ and includes engine modules, plugins, and game-side systems tailored for competitive fighters.
It integrates rollback networking through a GGPO-based plugin and provides tooling such as a collision editor to support gameplay iteration.
The framework targets developers and technical designers who want to prototype or ship modern fighting games on higher-end PC and console hardware.
