ProGuard is a Java bytecode shrinker, optimizer, obfuscator, and preverifier for applications and libraries. It removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes to reduce package size and improve runtime efficiency. The tool also applies bytecode optimizations and renames symbols to make reverse engineering harder while preserving behavior through configurable rules. It is implemented primarily in Java and commonly integrated through command-line workflows and Gradle builds for software protection and deployment hardening.
