This project is a modern Java bytecode editing and reverse-engineering workstation for JVM and Android targets.
It is implemented in Java and provides multiple decompilers, bytecode assembly tools, recompilation support, and deep search across classes, constants, and instruction patterns.
It also includes deobfuscation-oriented workflows such as automatic handling of malformed inputs, renaming assistance, and transformer utilities.
The primary audience is reverse engineers, security researchers, and developers analyzing or modifying compiled Java software.
