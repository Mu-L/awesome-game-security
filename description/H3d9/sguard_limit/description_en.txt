sguard_limit is a Windows toolkit intended to restrict or patch behaviors in an ACE-Guard protected game client. The repository combines a user-mode C++ controller with a kernel-mode module written in C and assembly for memory patching and process manipulation. It includes routines for virtual memory operations, VAD traversal, suspend and resume control, and detour-based hooks in a Visual Studio solution. The project is aimed at anti-cheat reverse engineering and bypass experimentation rather than general application development.
