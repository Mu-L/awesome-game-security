This project is a Windows C++ game-hacking framework for Apex that combines a kernel driver with a user-mode client. The driver side provides privileged memory operations and communication routines, while the user-mode side implements gameplay modules and process interaction. It uses DirectX9 and ImGui for overlay rendering and in-tool controls, alongside Visual Studio/WDK build targets. The primary use case is game security research focused on driver-assisted memory access and real-time overlay techniques.
