fastDbg is a high-speed x64 ELF debugger implemented in Go for Linux environments.
It supports breakpoint management, memory inspection, register operations, disassembly, and ptrace-based process control from a command interface.
The project also includes eBPF tracing support and QEMU-related modules for advanced low-level analysis workflows.
Its primary audience is reverse engineers and security researchers who need a lightweight but feature-rich debugging toolchain.
