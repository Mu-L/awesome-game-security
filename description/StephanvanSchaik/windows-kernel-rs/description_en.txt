This project is a Rust framework for developing Windows kernel drivers.
It combines low-level generated bindings with safer abstractions for kernel modules, device I/O, IRPs, synchronization primitives, and process attachment workflows.
The repository includes staged examples and build scaffolding that guide developers from basic driver setup to more structured implementations.
It is aimed at researchers and systems developers who want to explore Windows kernel programming with Rust in a safer architecture.
