WarriOrb is the public source-code release of a hardcore action platformer built with Unreal Engine. The project includes extensive C++ gameplay code, engine configuration, localization files, and platform packaging settings for multiple targets. The repository explicitly focuses on code and omits commercial game assets and some proprietary plugins, so it is not a full rebuild package. Its main use case is studying production Unreal game architecture and implementation patterns.
