This project is a real-time 3D software renderer that runs entirely on the CPU. It is written in C++17 with SDL2 and includes rasterization, depth testing, multiple shading models, post-processing effects, and OBJ and TGA asset support. The engine offers both scalar and SIMD paths, thread-pool based triangle work distribution, and interactive camera and HUD controls. It is primarily intended for graphics education and low-level rendering performance research.
