This project is a Windows external cheat framework for Counter-Strike 2 that focuses on kernel-assisted read-only data access. It is written primarily in C++ with an ImGui-style menu, rendering modules, and extensive configurable ESP and radar features. The codebase emphasizes automation such as offset update support and UI customization for visual overlays. It is intended for cheat development experiments and anti-cheat detection research in competitive shooter environments.
