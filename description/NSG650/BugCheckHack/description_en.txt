This project is a Windows driver and user-mode utility for modifying BSOD appearance and behavior.
It manages kernel loading through a service workflow, resolves required kernel offsets, and patches bugcheck-related routines.
The codebase is mostly C and C++ with a desktop controller application and supporting kernel components.
It is intended for low-level Windows crash mechanism research and demonstration of kernel patching techniques.
