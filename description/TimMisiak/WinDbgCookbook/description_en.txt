This project is a collection of practical WinDbg automation scripts and debugger queries. It is mainly written in JavaScript for the WinDbg data model and includes utilities for dependency inspection, stack collection, stack corruption detection, and time-travel debugging analysis. The README also provides many ready-to-run dx command examples for module, thread, and environment inspection. Its primary use case is improving productivity for Windows reverse engineers and debugging-focused security researchers.
