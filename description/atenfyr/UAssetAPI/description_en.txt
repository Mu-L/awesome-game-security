This project is a low-level .NET library for reading and writing Unreal Engine asset files. It supports a broad range of cooked and uncooked versions, many property and export types, JSON round-tripping, Kismet bytecode handling, and optional .usmap parsing for unversioned data. The implementation is primarily C# and is designed to preserve binary fidelity when editing assets programmatically. It targets modding, tooling, and reverse-engineering workflows for Unreal-based games.
