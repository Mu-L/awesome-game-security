This project is a server-side occlusion-culling system designed to reduce wallhack visibility in multiplayer shooters. It is primarily written in C++ with Unreal Engine project files, and uses analytical ray casts instead of coarse visibility approximations. The implementation combines recent-occluder caching, BVH acceleration, and latency-aware lookahead checks to keep culling fast while reducing popping artifacts. It is intended for anti-cheat and game security research on scalable line-of-sight enforcement.
