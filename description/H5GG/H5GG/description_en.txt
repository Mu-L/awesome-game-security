H5GG is an iOS modding engine that combines JavaScript scripting APIs with an HTML5-based user interface. It provides memory editing functions, script loading from local or remote sources, dynamic plugin support, and automatic static pointer chain search utilities. The project also includes multiple runtime modes for jailbroken and non-jailbroken environments and an h5frida plugin for Objective-C and C/C++ function hooking and patching. It is primarily used for mobile game modding, runtime instrumentation, and iOS game security research.
