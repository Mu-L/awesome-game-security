This project is a standalone implementation of the Zygisk runtime for rooted Android environments. It provides Zygisk API compatibility for KernelSU and can replace Magisk's built-in Zygisk mode. The README documents platform requirements across KernelSU, Magisk, and APatch, along with behavior and compatibility notes. It is mainly used by advanced Android modding and security users who need Zygisk-based module support outside the default Magisk stack.
