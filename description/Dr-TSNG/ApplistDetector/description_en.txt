This project is an Android detection library and demo app for identifying suspicious software environments such as Magisk and Xposed. It is built with Kotlin and native C++ components, combining package inspection, filesystem artifact checks, syscall-based file probing, and Xposed status detection. The code also includes checks for dual or work profile anomalies and known rooting-related traces. It is primarily intended for mobile anti-cheat, root-detection, and app integrity research.
