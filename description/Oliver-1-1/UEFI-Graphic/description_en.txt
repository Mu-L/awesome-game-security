This project is a C++ UEFI graphics framework that simplifies drawing in pre-boot environments. It wraps low-level UEFI protocols and framebuffer handling behind reusable classes for screens, colors, text, and basic shapes. The codebase includes support goals and implementations for mouse input and simple file operations, built with a VisualUefi workflow. It targets firmware developers and low-level security researchers who need custom graphical tools before the operating system loads.
