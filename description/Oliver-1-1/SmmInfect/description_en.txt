This project is an SMM backdoor research framework that pairs a firmware-level SMI handler with user-mode clients. It includes UEFI and EDK2 components plus Windows and Linux-side code to trigger SMIs and exchange data with privileged SMM logic. The repository documents build and BIOS patching steps, hardware requirements, and secure-boot or firmware constraints. It is aimed at advanced platform security research on firmware trust boundaries and high-privilege persistence.
