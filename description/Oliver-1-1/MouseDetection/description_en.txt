This project is a minimal Windows proof of concept for detecting mouse movement generated by software rather than hardware. It provides native C++ code that monitors movement behavior and demonstrates simulated motion APIs for testing. The repository is intentionally small and focused on one detection concept instead of a full anti-cheat stack. It is useful as a starting point for input validation research.
