This project is a proof-of-concept detector for emulated keyboard input on Windows using ETW traces. It monitors USB-related telemetry paths and compares observed events to distinguish physical key presses from software-generated input. The implementation is in C++ and currently requires manual setup and keyboard-specific tuning. It is aimed at anti-cheat and endpoint security research focused on input integrity.
