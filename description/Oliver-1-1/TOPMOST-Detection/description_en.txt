This project is a small Windows C++ utility that detects topmost windows on the desktop. It enumerates visible windows with Win32 APIs and checks extended styles such as WS_EX_TOPMOST to flag always-on-top overlays. The solution also includes a companion console app that marks itself as topmost using SetWindowPos for testing. It is mainly useful for anti-cheat prototyping and game security experiments that need basic overlay detection logic.
