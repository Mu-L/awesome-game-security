RustDMACheat is a DMA-oriented cheat framework for the game Rust. It provides ESP and gameplay modification features such as recoil adjustments, FOV changes, lighting tweaks, and admin-related views through a configurable codebase. The project is written mainly in C++ and references common DMA ecosystem tooling like PCILeech, MemProcFS, Il2CppDumper, and DMALibrary. It is intended for hardware-assisted memory access research and external game cheating workflows.
