This project is a lightweight multiplayer Snake game prototype built in a short development sprint. It is implemented in C++ with a custom networking layer and supports hosting or joining matches from the command line. The source includes game logic, serialization, socket handling, and optional headless server hosting for simple deployment. It is primarily aimed at learning and experimenting with real-time multiplayer game programming rather than security research.
