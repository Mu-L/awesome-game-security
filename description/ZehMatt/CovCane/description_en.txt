This project is an experimental dynamic binary instrumentation framework for x86-64 binaries on Windows. It is written in C++ and organized with a loader, an instrumentation runtime, and a dedicated test target for validation. The codebase includes components for translation, rewriting, memory handling, and exception processing, with dependencies on Zydis and AsmJIT. It is mainly useful for reverse engineering, runtime analysis, and low-level binary research.
