This project is an x64dbg plugin that adds Lua scripting support to the debugger. It combines C/C++ plugin code with an embedded Lua runtime and bundled Lua libraries to automate debugger workflows. The plugin exposes functionality around memory, registers, breakpoints, labels, modules, and assembler operations, and also supports autorun scripts and examples. It is useful for reverse engineers and game security researchers who want scriptable debugging and analysis.
