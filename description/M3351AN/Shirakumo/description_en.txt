This project is a proof-of-concept RPM/WPM proxy that forwards memory operations through named pipes. It is written in C++ and separates read/write execution into another process, with optional DLL loading for proxy deployment. The implementation is explicitly experimental, with noted limitations such as x64-only support and lack of thread safety. It is mainly used to study process-separated memory access patterns for game tooling and evasion research.
