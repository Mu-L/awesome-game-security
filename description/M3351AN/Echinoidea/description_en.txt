This project is a lightweight open-source external CS:GO cheat focused on reducing obvious write-based detection signals. It is primarily implemented in C# and includes common features such as bunnyhop, overlay ESP, and trigger bot behavior. The project references offset-driven workflows and discusses anti-cheat risk considerations for public builds. Its main use case is educational experimentation with external cheat design and VAC-era detection tradeoffs.
