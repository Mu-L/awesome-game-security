NoEye is a BattlEye bypass toolkit intended to counter specific protection behavior in game environments.
The repository includes native C++ components, a dedicated Windows service layer, and a C# setup application for deployment tasks.
Its code structure covers service installation, process interaction, and runtime control modules built around Visual Studio projects.
It is mainly relevant as a historical anti-cheat bypass reference for researchers analyzing older BattlEye-focused techniques.
