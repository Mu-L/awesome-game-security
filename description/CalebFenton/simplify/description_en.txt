This project is an Android deobfuscation framework that simplifies Dalvik bytecode by virtually executing app logic. It is primarily written in Java and includes a VM component, optimization passes, and demo materials for analysis workflows. The optimizer performs transformations such as constant propagation, dead code removal, and reflection cleanup to make recovered code easier to understand. It is aimed at reverse engineers and mobile security researchers analyzing obfuscated applications.
