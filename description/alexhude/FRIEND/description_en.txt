FRIEND is an IDA plugin that enhances disassembly with richer register and instruction documentation directly in the analysis view. It extends processor behavior with third-party components such as Capstone and adds contextual hints, external documentation links, and function summaries in disassembly and decompiler views. The codebase uses C++ with CMake and integrates with IDA SDK and optional Hex-Rays SDK support across Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is primarily designed for reverse engineers who need faster code understanding, including game security analysts.
