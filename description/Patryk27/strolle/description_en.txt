This project is a real-time renderer focused on dynamic global illumination experiments. It is implemented in Rust and can run as a standalone renderer through wgpu or as an integrated component within Bevy-based projects. The rendering work emphasizes modern sampling and lighting ideas such as ReSTIR and targets usable performance on consumer GPUs, including systems without dedicated ray-tracing cores. It is mainly aimed at graphics programmers and engine researchers prototyping advanced real-time lighting techniques.
