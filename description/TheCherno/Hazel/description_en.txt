This project is an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine focused on C++ game engine architecture.
It ships with engine, editor, and sandbox components and setup scripts that prepare dependencies such as Vulkan SDK tooling.
The codebase is primarily C++ and is developed as both a functional engine and an educational reference for engine design.
Its primary use case is learning and prototyping real-time rendering and game framework systems.
