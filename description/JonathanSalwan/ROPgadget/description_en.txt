This project is a command-line tool for finding return-oriented programming gadgets in binary files. It is written in Python and uses the Capstone disassembly engine to support ELF, PE, Mach-O, and raw binaries across many CPU architectures. It offers filtering, searching, and optional ROP chain generation features for exploit development workflows. The primary use case is binary exploitation and reverse engineering research.
