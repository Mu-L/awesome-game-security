This project is an open source credential recovery framework that extracts locally stored passwords from many applications. It is primarily written in Python and provides modular collectors for different software families and storage mechanisms. The tool supports multiple platforms and is commonly used in post-exploitation, auditing, and forensic workflows. It is most relevant to security professionals who need to assess credential exposure on compromised or test systems.
