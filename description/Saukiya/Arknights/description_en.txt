This project is a Unity-style reimplementation of Arknights gameplay code without bundled original game assets.
It is mostly written in C# and organizes systems for characters, monsters, dungeons, UI flows, events, and core game state management.
The codebase also includes manager layers for resources, audio, shop logic, and Lua script integration points.
It is useful for developers and researchers studying Unity project architecture and prototyping tower-defense RPG mechanics.
