This project is the OpenArena game engine codebase, maintained as a fork of ioquake3 for OpenArena-specific client and server behavior. It is a large C/C++ engine tree with renderer, audio, networking, and game runtime components derived from the Quake III technology stack. The repository uses traditional make-based builds and includes platform support files and tooling for multiple targets. It is mainly used by engine developers, modders, and researchers studying classic FPS engine internals and multiplayer game architecture.
