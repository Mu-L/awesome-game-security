This project is a runtime inspection application for Apple platforms that explores Objective-C and Swift metadata from loaded binaries and frameworks.
It is primarily built in Swift with Objective-C components and includes communication layers for local or networked runtime access.
Core features include interface browsing, syntax-highlighted views, export of discovered interfaces, framework loading, and work-in-progress code injection support.
Its primary use case is reverse engineering, dynamic analysis, and runtime exploration for macOS and related Apple platform targets.
