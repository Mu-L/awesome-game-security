This project is a Model Context Protocol server that bridges large language model tooling with IDA Pro analysis data.
It is implemented in Python and includes both a standalone server package and an IDA plugin for bidirectional communication.
The system provides automation-oriented capabilities for querying disassembly context, running analysis workflows, and integrating with MCP-compatible clients.
Its main audience is reverse engineers who want AI-assisted interaction with IDA databases.
