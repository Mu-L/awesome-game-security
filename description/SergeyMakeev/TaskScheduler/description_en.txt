This project is a cross-platform, fiber-based task scheduler designed for high-performance game workloads. It is a C++ library that provides multi-threaded job execution, task grouping, work-stealing style scheduling behavior, and platform abstractions for Windows and POSIX targets. The repository includes extensive tests, examples, and third-party low-level context-switching components needed for fiber systems. It is primarily aimed at engine programmers who need a scalable job system for parallel game logic and rendering pipelines.
