ApiBreakpoint is a GUI plugin for x64dbg that makes setting API breakpoints faster and easier during Windows reverse engineering.
It is written in C++ with the x64dbg plugin SDK and built in Visual Studio for both x86 and x64 targets.
The plugin provides a visual workflow to configure and manage breakpoints instead of relying only on manual debugger commands.
It is mainly aimed at malware analysts, reverse engineers, and game security researchers who need quick runtime API tracing.
