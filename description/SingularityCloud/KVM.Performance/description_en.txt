This repository is a small knowledge base for improving KVM virtual machine behavior when running games and anti-cheat-protected software. It mainly contains Markdown notes and reference links about ioapic driver tuning, split-lock issues, and unhandled WRMSR or RDMSR errors on hosts like Unraid and Proxmox. Rather than shipping executable code, it focuses on troubleshooting guidance and configuration hints for virtualization edge cases. The primary audience is users and researchers debugging game launch failures or performance problems in virtualized environments.
