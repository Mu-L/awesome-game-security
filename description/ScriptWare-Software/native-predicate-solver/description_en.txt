This project is a native Binary Ninja plugin for removing opaque predicates from obfuscated binaries. It is implemented in modern C++ and analyzes MLIL conditional branches to detect always-true or always-false conditions. The plugin supports single-function and whole-binary passes, configurable limits, and multithreaded processing for speed on large programs. It is intended for reverse engineers who need faster deobfuscation workflows during malware analysis or protected binary research.
