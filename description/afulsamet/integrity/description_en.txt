integrity is a header-only C library for runtime memory integrity verification of Windows PE images. It computes baseline checksums for non-writable sections and re-checks them later to detect unauthorized code modifications. The implementation supports hardware-accelerated CRC32 with SSE4.2 and allows custom checksum algorithms through compile-time configuration. This library targets defensive use cases such as tamper detection, anti-cheat hardening, and runtime self-protection experiments.
