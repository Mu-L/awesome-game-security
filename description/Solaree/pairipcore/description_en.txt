This project is a research-focused documentation set about Google's pairipcore Android application protection. It describes mechanisms such as integrity checks, pseudo-VM code injection, control-flow obfuscation, dynamic symbol resolution, anti-debugging logic, and optional root-related restrictions. The repository is written as reverse engineering notes with an explicit educational framing rather than a production bypass implementation. Its main audience is mobile security and anti-tamper researchers analyzing protected Android apps.
