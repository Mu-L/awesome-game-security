This project is an IDA Pro plugin for managing and organizing user comments during reverse engineering.
It is written in Python 3 and hooks comment-related actions so new annotations can be captured and displayed in a dedicated view.
The plugin targets IDA 7.x and 8.x workflows and provides keyboard and menu access for quick review of comment data.
It is useful for reverse engineers who need better note management while analyzing binaries, including game clients and anti-cheat modules.
