This project is an external cheat-style implementation for a Unity-based game using memory access and overlay rendering. The C++ code maintains offset tables, reads entity and player state data, and renders ESP-style visuals such as boxes and names through an NVIDIA overlay window. It also includes hotkey-driven menu controls and automation-oriented combat assistance logic. The repository is primarily used for cheat development practice and reverse engineering of game runtime structures.
