This project is a Source engine SDK codebase used for Half-Life 2 era game development and engine integration work. It contains extensive C/C++ headers and source for client, server, game logic, tools, and build infrastructure across multiple platforms. The repository serves as a foundational reference for creating mods, plugins, and engine-side extensions in Source-based titles. It is widely useful for game engine research, reverse engineering, and prototyping cheat or anti-cheat related experiments on Source games.
