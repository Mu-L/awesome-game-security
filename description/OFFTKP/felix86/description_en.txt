felix86 is a Linux userspace emulator that runs x86 and x86-64 programs on RISC-V processors. It uses a JIT recompiler, vectorized SSE translation, and multiple RISC-V extensions to improve compatibility and performance. The project is implemented mainly in modern C++ and integrates external libraries for decoding, formatting, and testing. It is designed for emulator developers and low-level systems researchers exploring cross-architecture execution.
