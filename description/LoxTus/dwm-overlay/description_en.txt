This project is a DLL-based DWM overlay proof of concept for Windows that hooks desktop composition rendering. It is implemented in C++ with MinHook, DirectX 11, and ImGui, and uses pattern scanning to locate the target present routine in dwmcore. After hooking, it initializes a D3D11 render path and draws custom UI content through the swap chain. The project is mainly useful for graphics hook research, overlay experimentation, and understanding desktop-level rendering interception.
