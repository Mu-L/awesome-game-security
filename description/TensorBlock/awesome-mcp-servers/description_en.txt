This project is a large curated index of Model Context Protocol servers and related integrations.
It is organized as Markdown documentation with category pages that track tools across AI, data, infrastructure, security, gaming, and many other domains.
Instead of implementing one server, it focuses on discovery, cataloging, and quick navigation for thousands of MCP entries.
The primary audience is developers and researchers building AI workflows that need ready-made MCP tool backends.
