This repository contains Windows kernel programming experiments implemented as proof-of-concept drivers and companion user-mode tools. The focus is on low-level internals such as memory manager behavior, including examples like listing process VAD structures. It uses C/C++ with Visual Studio and WDK-style projects and documents strong version coupling to specific Windows builds and symbols. The project is intended for educational kernel research and controlled security experimentation rather than production deployment.
