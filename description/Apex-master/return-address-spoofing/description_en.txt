This project is a compact return-address spoofing implementation for native function invocation bypass scenarios. It uses C++ templates and x64 assembly stubs to redirect control flow while preserving expected calling behavior. The code is lightweight and intended to be integrated into an existing invoker pipeline. Its primary audience is low-level game security researchers exploring anti-detection evasion techniques.
