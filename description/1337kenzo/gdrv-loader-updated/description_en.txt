This project is a Windows utility for loading unsigned kernel drivers on modern systems.
It is an updated C/C++ loader that improves compatibility with Windows 10 and 11 and streamlines vulnerable-driver byte loading.
The tool exposes a simple command-line workflow for loading and unloading target drivers during testing.
Its main use case is kernel security research and controlled lab experiments that require unsigned driver execution.
