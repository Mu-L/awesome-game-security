This project is the manifest repository used to define and sync PixelOS source trees. It is mainly composed of XML manifest files plus documentation that explains repo initialization, syncing, and ROM build steps. The repository provides default and revision-locked manifests and snippet files to control which upstream Android projects are fetched. It is intended for ROM maintainers and builders who compile and track PixelOS releases.
