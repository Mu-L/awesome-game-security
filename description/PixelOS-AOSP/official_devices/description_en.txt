This project is a metadata and documentation repository for officially supported PixelOS devices. It primarily uses Markdown and JSON to publish device lists, API data, changelog-style notes, and release communication templates. The content helps track supported brands and models and standardizes how maintainers present build and release information. It is mainly useful for PixelOS maintainers and users who need an authoritative support matrix.
