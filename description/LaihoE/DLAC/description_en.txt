DLAC is a deep-learning anti-cheat package for CS:GO demo analysis that predicts suspicious aim behavior on a per-shot basis.
It combines Python inference code with a Go-based demo parser and supports ONNX runtime models in different size and accuracy profiles.
Users can export predictions to terminal output, CSV, or in-memory lists and tune confidence thresholds for practical workflows.
The project targets anti-cheat experimentation and research on replay-based behavioral detection.
