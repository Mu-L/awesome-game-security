This project is a PE patching and infection framework that injects custom payloads into Windows executables while preserving original behavior. It includes a C core for PE parsing and modification, plus control and interception components in Python and Java. Key capabilities include multiple infection methods, patch generation for transfer-time modification, and web-based remote configuration. It is intended for executable research, red-team simulations, and analysis of defensive mechanisms around PE tampering.
