This project is a Windows anti-debug exploration tool for testing debugger resilience against real anti-debug techniques. It implements a large collection of checks and tricks from malware samples and published research, and exposes relevant function addresses for hands-on experimentation. Researchers can attach debuggers and compare behavior across different tools, plugins, and mitigation strategies on modern Windows versions. It is aimed at reverse engineers, malware analysts, and tool developers validating anti-anti-debug capabilities.
