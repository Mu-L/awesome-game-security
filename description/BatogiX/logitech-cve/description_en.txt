This project is a Rust library for interacting with a Logitech virtual driver to emulate input events. It provides typed APIs for mouse movement, clicks, wheel actions, keyboard presses, multi-key input, and text typing routines. The implementation uses Windows native interfaces and device I/O control calls to communicate with the underlying driver handle. The primary use case is input-emulation research, automation experiments, and vulnerable-driver attack-surface analysis in game security contexts.
