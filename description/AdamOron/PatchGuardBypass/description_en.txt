This project is an in-progress research effort focused on bypassing Windows PatchGuard on modern systems. It documents a planned dynamic approach with three core goals: disabling PatchGuard execution, evading integrity checks at runtime, and verifying PatchGuard state. The implementation is centered on low-level Windows internals and kernel-mode behavior, with C/C++ code used for experimentation. It is primarily intended for kernel security researchers and anti-cheat analysts studying defensive mechanisms and their attack surface.
