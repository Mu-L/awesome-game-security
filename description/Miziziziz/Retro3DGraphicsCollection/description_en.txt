This project is a curated collection of commercially usable retro 3D assets in a PS1 style. It is delivered as a README-centered index that links models, textures, and related packs under permissive usage expectations such as CC0-style terms. The collection also references shader resources and organizes content by themes like nature, contemporary, fantasy, and UI-oriented assets. Its main use case is helping indie developers and prototyping teams quickly source retro visual content for game production.
