This project is an SDK generation tool for Valve Source Engine titles. It is implemented in C++ and appears to parse networked class and data-table structures to emit usable class definitions and offsets. The repository includes project files and supporting code for building generated structures from client metadata. It is mainly useful for game reverse engineering and tooling workflows that rely on up-to-date Source-engine SDK representations.
