This project is a .NET-based memory class reconstruction and remote process inspection tool.
It supports x86 and x64 targets, rich memory node types, scanners, debuggers, and import/export compatibility with older ReClass formats.
The codebase combines C# UI logic with native C++ core components for low-level process and memory operations.
It is widely used in reverse engineering and game security research to map runtime structures and generate C++ or C# class layouts.
