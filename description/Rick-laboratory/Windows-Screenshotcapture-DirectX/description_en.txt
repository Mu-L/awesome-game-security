This project is a minimal Windows DirectX 9 screenshot capture example. It creates a Direct3D9 device, grabs the front buffer with GetFrontBufferData, and copies frame pixels into system memory buffers. It uses Windows Imaging Component APIs to encode and save the captured frames as PNG files. It is useful for graphics tooling prototypes and for understanding DirectX-based frame capture techniques in game research.
