This project is a lightweight offset database for Fortnite. It is provided as a JSON file that stores key memory offsets for engine pointers, entity structures, camera data, and weapon-related fields. The repository contains data rather than application logic, making it easy to consume from external tools. Its primary use case is keeping cheat or research tooling synchronized with current game memory layouts.
