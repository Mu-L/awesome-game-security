This project is a Windows C++ automation utility that tracks Counter-Strike: Global Offensive updates and triggers offset dumping. It uses steamcmd commands, build ID parsing, and a timed loop to detect new game builds. When an update is found, it launches a local dumper executable and follow-up scripts to refresh generated data. It is primarily intended for maintaining up-to-date reverse engineering artifacts with minimal manual work.
