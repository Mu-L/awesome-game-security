This project is a maintained offset database for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive memory structures. It ships machine-readable outputs such as JSON plus C++ and C# offset definitions for direct integration into external tools. The repository includes signature patterns and configuration data designed to be refreshed automatically by a companion updater pipeline. It is mainly used by game reverse engineers and tooling developers who need current offsets after game patches.
