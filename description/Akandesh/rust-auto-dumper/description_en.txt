This project is a C++ auto-dumping and parsing pipeline for the game Rust. It monitors Steam build IDs, executes dump scripts, and parses generated dump.cs and script data with regex-based extraction. The tool then emits structured outputs such as JSON, C++ headers, and C# constants, including variants for encrypted fields. It is mainly used by game security researchers and tooling developers who need synchronized Rust offset data in multiple formats.
