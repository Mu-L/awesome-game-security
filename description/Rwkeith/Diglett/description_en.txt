This project is a kernel-mode proof of concept focused on stealth behavior in Windows. It implements thread-related hiding tactics, including hiding system threads and altering thread entry address visibility characteristics. The repository contains both driver and client components that demonstrate low-level control and communication patterns. It is mainly useful for anti-cheat evasion research and for defenders studying kernel-thread detection blind spots.
