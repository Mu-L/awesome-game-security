KVM-GPU-Passthrough is an Arch Linux focused setup project for building a GPU passthrough virtual machine environment. It provides shell scripts and config templates for GRUB, libvirt, and QEMU host configuration steps. The project documents hardware virtualization prerequisites such as IOMMU, VT-d, and related BIOS settings for AMD and Intel systems. It is intended for advanced users building isolated gaming or security research labs with near-native graphics in a guest VM.
