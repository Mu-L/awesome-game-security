This project is a Python toolkit for running IDA Pro in headless workflows. It can be used as a module or command-line utility to execute IDAPython scripts, run one-liners, and open interactive sessions without the GUI. It also supports a remote server mode through RPyC and can work with idat64 or idalib backends. The primary use case is scalable reverse engineering automation for malware analysis, binary research, and game security investigations.
