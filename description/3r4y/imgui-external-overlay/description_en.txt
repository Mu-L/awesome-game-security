This project is a C++ template for building an external Windows overlay with DirectX9 and ImGui.
It provides a ready-made overlay window and rendering flow that can be adapted for out-of-process visual drawing.
The code and setup notes focus on integrating ImGui sources and DirectX SDK dependencies in Visual Studio projects.
It is commonly used as a starting point for game security prototypes such as ESP visual layers, diagnostics HUDs, or reverse engineering overlays.
