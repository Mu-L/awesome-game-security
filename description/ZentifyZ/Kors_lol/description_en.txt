This project is a C++ internal Rust cheat source with rendering, hook management, and gameplay feature modules. It provides components for ESP-style visuals, internal logic hooks, Unity/IL2CPP structure access, and configurable menu systems built with ImGui. The repository also includes bypass-oriented utilities such as detours, import/scan helpers, and spoofcall routines for low-level call handling. It is primarily intended for game cheat prototyping and reverse engineering practice.
