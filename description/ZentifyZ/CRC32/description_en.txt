This project is a C++ internal cheat framework targeting the game Rust. It includes gameplay modules for visuals, hooks, math, weapon logic, and Unity/IL2CPP data access, plus an ImGui-based in-game menu. The codebase also contains anti-cheat related bypass utilities, detours, pattern scanning, and spoofed call helpers implemented with C++ and assembly. It is mainly aimed at cheat development and anti-cheat bypass experimentation.
