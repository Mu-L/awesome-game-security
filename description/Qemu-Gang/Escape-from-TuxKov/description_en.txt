This project is a C++ Escape from Tarkov cheat framework designed to run through QEMU-based workflows.
It includes gameplay modules such as ESP, aimbot, and recoil control, with separate components for memory access and data collection.
The code integrates Unity and Mono game structures and provides scripts for build, injection, extraction, and rapid reload.
It targets game hacking researchers experimenting with Linux/QEMU external or hybrid setups.
