This project is a QEMU and memflow port of an Unreal Engine 4.25 dumper for extracting runtime metadata.
It is implemented in C++ and scans target processes to locate object arrays, name pools, and engine-specific offsets.
The tool can dump names and objects and is structured so per-game offsets can be added in engine configuration code.
It is primarily used in Unreal reverse engineering and game security research workflows.
