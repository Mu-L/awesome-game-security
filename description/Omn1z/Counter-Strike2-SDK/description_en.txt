This project is a header-only Counter-Strike 2 SDK snapshot that exposes large sets of Source 2 class declarations and enums. It provides structured C++ definitions for entities, gameplay systems, animation types, and many engine data layouts with field offsets. The SDK also includes engine utility types such as bit vector implementations used by networked game data structures. It is primarily intended for reverse engineering, tooling, and game security research that requires up-to-date internal type information.
