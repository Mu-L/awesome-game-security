This project is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 focused on modern systems. It recreates park simulation gameplay while adding improvements such as cooperative multiplayer, improved interface and AI behavior, expanded editing tools, and higher engine limits. The codebase is primarily C++ with CMake-based build paths and broad platform support, while also exposing scripting and plugin integration points. It is intended for both players and developers who want a maintainable, extensible simulation engine for amusement park game technology.
