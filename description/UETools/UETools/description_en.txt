This project is a set of .NET libraries for reading Unreal Engine 4 binary asset data. It includes components for opening PAK-based virtual file systems and parsing asset structures and registries. The implementation is primarily in C# and is organized as reusable modules for tooling workflows. It is intended for Unreal asset inspection, modding utilities, and technical research on game content formats.
