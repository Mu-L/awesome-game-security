This project is a collection of Lua extensions and utility scripts for Cheat Engine. It includes an extension loader plus scripts for tasks such as breakpoint cleanup, function-caller lookup, template insertion, and interface workflow improvements. The package is designed to be placed in Cheat Engine's autorun directory so features load automatically. Its primary use case is speeding up reverse engineering and memory analysis workflows for game security practitioners.
