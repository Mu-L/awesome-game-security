Le Chiffre is a lightweight external CS:GO cheat proof of concept written in C++. It implements common gameplay automation features such as bunnyhop, triggerbot, aimbot, glow ESP, and radar hacks. The project is structured as an educational codebase to demonstrate memory-based game manipulation and reverse engineering fundamentals. It is primarily targeted at learners studying low-level Windows game hacking techniques rather than production use.
