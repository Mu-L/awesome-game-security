This project is a large C++ game modification framework for Genshin Impact with an injector and in-game menu system.
It provides a broad feature set including protection bypass routines, player and world modifiers, teleport helpers, ESP-style visuals, and debugging utilities.
The repository includes substantial native code, assets, and multilingual documentation, with public releases distributed even as newer source revisions became more restricted.
It is primarily used by game hacking and game security researchers studying client-side manipulation techniques in Unity-based titles.
