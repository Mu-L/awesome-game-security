This project is a collection of Windows kernel research tools and demos commonly associated with ARK-style system inspection utilities. It includes examples for debug-register hooks, IDT and GDT hook methods, kernel APC injection, Shadow SSDT inline hooking, registry operations via drivers, and WOW64 cross-architecture injection. The codebase is primarily C and C++ with multiple Visual Studio projects covering standalone experiments and a larger integrated tool. It is intended for low-level security researchers studying Windows internals, rootkit techniques, and defensive detection.
