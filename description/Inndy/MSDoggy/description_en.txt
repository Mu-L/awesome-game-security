MSDoggy is an old MapleStory game hack project from the Taiwan community. It contains C/C++ and inline assembly hooks for gameplay manipulation, including behavior changes for mobs and item-related filtering logic. The code reflects legacy cheat development practices with low-level patching and optional protector integration. It is primarily useful as a historical reference for MMORPG cheat research.
