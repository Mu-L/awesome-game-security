This project is a C++ cheat source package for Call of Duty gameplay enhancement through external visualization and targeting assistance.
It contains overlay rendering code, player and entity data handling, and communication routines commonly used for driver-backed memory reads.
The codebase also includes Direct3D9 and ImGui-based template components for menu and ESP style interfaces.
It is mainly intended for game hacking learners and reverse engineering practitioners studying Windows overlay and memory interaction pipelines.
