This project is an internal Fortnite cheat implementation with a menu-driven feature set for aiming, ESP, and movement exploits.
It is built in C++ and uses DirectX9 and ImGui components for rendering in-game visuals and controls.
The repository describes options such as box and line ESP, silent aiming modes, FOV changes, teleport-style actions, and panic-key behavior.
It is intended for cheat development experimentation and reverse engineering practice around injection, hooking, and overlay workflows.
