Phoenix-Valorant-Cheat is an external Valorant cheat project focused on ESP, aimbot, and rage-mode style features.
It is implemented mainly in C++ with a Visual Studio solution and uses OpenGL/GLFW plus ImGui for rendering the on-screen menu and overlay.
The codebase includes offset definitions, vector math utilities, and external memory-interaction logic commonly used in Windows game hacking tools.
Its primary use case is game security research and experimentation with external cheat architecture for Riot's shooter environment.
