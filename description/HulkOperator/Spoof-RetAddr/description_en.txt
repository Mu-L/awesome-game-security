This project is a proof-of-concept implementation for spoofing WinAPI return addresses on x64 systems.
It combines C and NASM assembly to demonstrate stack manipulation techniques in a compact reusable example.
The code illustrates call-stack obfuscation concepts frequently discussed in red-team and anti-detection contexts.
It is intended for educational use in reverse engineering and low-level calling-convention research.
