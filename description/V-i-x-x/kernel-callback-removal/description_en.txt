This project documents and implements an ETW-TI kernel bypass technique that toggles provider state from kernel memory. It explains how to locate relevant Windows kernel structures, discover offsets, and modify enable flags using an existing read/write primitive. The repository combines C++ implementation code with detailed WinDbg and IDA-based reverse engineering notes. It is intended for advanced educational research by pentesters and defenders studying EDR bypass methods.
