This project is a user-mode external framework for Apex Legends cheating research.
It is written in C++ and demonstrates shared-memory communication with a mapped kernel driver for process read and write operations.
The sample feature set includes glow and highlight manipulation along with a minimal baseline architecture for extension.
Its primary use case is educational experimentation with external cheat design and driver-assisted memory access patterns.
