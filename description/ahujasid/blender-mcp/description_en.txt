blender-mcp connects Blender to AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol so scenes can be inspected and edited by natural-language commands. The project combines a Blender addon with a Python MCP server that communicates over a socket-based JSON protocol. It supports object and material manipulation, scene queries, scripted code execution, and optional integrations for external assets and generated 3D models. The primary use case is AI-assisted 3D content creation and rapid scene prototyping for artists and developers.
