FridaDetectionBypass is a practical collection of techniques for bypassing common Frida detection methods on Android targets. It documents and demonstrates countermeasures for debugger checks, default-port detection, protocol fingerprinting, and memory artifact scanning. The repository mixes JavaScript hooks, command-line configurations, and native Android/JNI components for script injection workflows without relying solely on standard gadget setups. It is intended for mobile reverse engineering and anti-tamper research where analysts need to evaluate or harden instrumentation resistance.
