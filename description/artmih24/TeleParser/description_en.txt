This project is a Python utility for collecting and processing data from Telegram channels and chats. It uses Telethon for API access and supports exporting parsed content to JSON and CSV while storing data in MongoDB. The repository includes cross-platform setup scripts for Windows and Unix-like systems and basic NLP-oriented dependencies such as pandas and NLTK. The documented use case is data collection and message analysis workflows, and the README warns that API changes may currently make it unsafe to run without updates.
