This project is an Android test application for generating, parsing, and verifying key attestation evidence. The app is built with Java and Kotlin and supports saving and loading certificate chains plus local and remote revocation list handling in this fork. Additional fork features include RSA attestation support, language and theme options, and privacy oriented certificate display controls. Its primary use case is mobile security validation, device integrity testing, and attestation research.
