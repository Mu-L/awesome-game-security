Zodiak is a full kernel driver cheat for Counter-Strike 1.6 designed to minimize user-visible traces on the system.
It is implemented in C and assembly, using techniques like kernel GDI-based ESP rendering and MouHID callback abuse for aimbot input control.
The project also documents automatic offset detection, thread context spoofing, and a compact single-thread execution model.
It is aimed at advanced game security researchers studying kernel-level cheat engineering and anti-cheat evasion strategies.
