Evelion is an external ESP cheat for Counter-Strike 1.6 written in C++.
It uses an ImGui-based overlay interface with configurable visuals and a stream-proof presentation model designed to stay outside normal game capture paths.
The project is structured for Visual Studio builds and targets a legacy CS 1.6 environment in windowed mode.
Its main audience is learners exploring external cheat architecture, rendering overlays, and basic anti-cheat evasion ideas.
