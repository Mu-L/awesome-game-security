This project provides a collection of resources for AI-assisted reverse engineering workflows in IDA Pro.
It is mostly composed of Python tooling and Markdown-based plugin and skill documentation.
The package includes guidance for plugin development, automated scripting, and optional code-evaluation setups for sandboxed analysis.
It is intended for reverse engineers who want repeatable, automation-heavy binary analysis pipelines.
