This project embeds a CyberChef-style data transformation interface inside IDA Pro.
It is implemented mainly in Python with a Qt-based UI layer and plugin metadata for IDA integration.
The tool enables decoding, encoding, and transformation pipelines without leaving the reverse engineering environment.
It is targeted at malware analysis and binary triage workflows that require rapid data manipulation.
