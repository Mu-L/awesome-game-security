This project is an IDA Pro plugin that downloads PDB symbol files from the Unity symbol server.
It is implemented in C++ as an IDA extension and focuses on automating symbol retrieval during interactive reverse engineering sessions.
By pulling matching debug symbols, it helps recover names and structural context in Unity-related binaries more quickly.
The plugin is primarily useful for game reverse engineering and game security analysis workflows inside IDA.
