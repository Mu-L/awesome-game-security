This project is a compact research example focused on CR3 shuffling behavior in Easy Anti-Cheat protected environments.
The C++ sample code shows low-level paging logic such as physical memory range walking, directory base discovery, and virtual-to-physical translation checks.
It is accompanied by reference material that explains why CR3 manipulation complicates external memory inspection workflows.
Its primary use case is reverse engineering and anti-cheat internals research, especially for understanding page table related protection strategies.
