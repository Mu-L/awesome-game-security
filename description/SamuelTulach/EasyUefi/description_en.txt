This project is a Visual Studio-oriented template for quickly building GNU-EFI-based UEFI applications for research use.
It combines C source code, assembly, linker scripts, and bundled GNU-EFI components to provide a ready-to-build environment on Windows.
The template focuses on simplifying setup and iteration rather than production hardening, making early firmware experiments faster.
It is primarily useful for firmware security research, boot-stage experimentation, and low-level game security tooling prototypes.
