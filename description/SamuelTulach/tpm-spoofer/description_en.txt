TPM Spoofer is a proof-of-concept project that explores manipulation of TPM-derived identifiers used in anti-cheat hardware tracking.
It contains a kernel-mode component that hooks TPM request handling paths and a user-mode utility for reading endorsement key related information.
The codebase is built with C and C++ on Visual Studio and WDK, and targets modern Windows TPM stack behavior.
Its primary use case is game security research focused on how TPM and EK-based signals can be inspected, intercepted, and validated.
