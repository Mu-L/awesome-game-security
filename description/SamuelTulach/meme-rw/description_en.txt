This repository is a proof-of-concept framework for accessing protected process memory in game security contexts.
It is written in C++ with CMake and includes driver-loading helpers, process and module utilities, and memory read and write control routines.
The implementation is based on a vulnerable-driver mapping approach and demonstrates end-to-end primitives for opening a target process and operating on its memory.
Its main use case is anti-cheat bypass experimentation and defensive research into how protected memory access techniques are built.
