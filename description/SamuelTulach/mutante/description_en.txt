mutante is a Windows kernel-mode HWID spoofer designed to alter several hardware identity sources.
The C and C++ code targets disk serial information, S.M.A.R.T. behavior, and SMBIOS table fields while avoiding permanent hook dependencies.
It ships as a Visual Studio driver project and reflects an older generation of anti-cheat evasion tooling.
Today it is most useful as an archival reference for low-level SMBIOS and storage identifier manipulation techniques in game security research.
