This project is a collection of Binary Ninja architecture plugins for analyzing Java class files, Renesas H8/300 binaries, and Xtensa ELF targets.
It is written mainly in Python and includes disassembly, instruction decoding, and partial lifting support for custom architectures.
The Java-focused module also supports patch-oriented workflows such as NOPing instructions and changing branch logic.
It is intended for reverse engineers who need fast extension support in Binary Ninja for firmware and bytecode analysis.
