Ape-ex Abominations is a DMA-oriented cheat project designed for Apex Legends workflows in QEMU and VFIO environments.
It combines C++ feature modules with shell-based tooling that automates gdb injection, extraction, and fast reload cycles.
The project includes interface discovery and pattern-scanning components and expects auxiliary input support from an evdev-mirror kernel module.
It is aimed at advanced game security researchers experimenting with virtualized or hardware-assisted cheating setups.
