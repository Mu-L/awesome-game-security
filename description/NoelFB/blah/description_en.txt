This project is a lightweight 2D game framework for C++.
It targets simple portability with few dependencies and a clean API for app lifecycle, rendering, input, audio, and math utilities.
The build setup uses CMake with C++17 and supports OpenGL or Direct3D11 renderer backends.
It is intended for developers who want a small and hackable engine base for 2D game prototypes.
