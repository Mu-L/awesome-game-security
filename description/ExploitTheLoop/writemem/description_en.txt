This project is a Java memory utility library for rooted Android processes. It exposes APIs for range search, offset filtering, value reads, writes, and periodic freeze writes across /proc memory maps. The code includes helper classes for data conversion, map parsing, and a small socket server thread for exposing memory values. Its main use case is game memory experimentation and automation on Android devices.
