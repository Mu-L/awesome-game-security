This project is a Python utility for decrypting and exporting saved browser passwords on Windows. It supports Chromium-based browsers and Firefox by handling profile databases, DPAPI/AES decryption, and Firefox key material parsing. The code includes ASN.1 parsing and browser-specific routines to recover credentials from common login storage formats. The primary use case is credential forensics, red-team lab research, and understanding browser secret storage behavior.
