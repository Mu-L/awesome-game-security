NonEuclidean is a Windows rendering demo engine that explores non-Euclidean space in real time. It is written in C++ with OpenGL and demonstrates custom room transitions, camera movement, and experimental geometric rendering behavior. The project is focused on graphics and engine experimentation rather than anti-cheat bypass, but it is useful for understanding low-level rendering pipelines that often matter in game security tooling. It targets developers and technical researchers interested in advanced game rendering concepts.
