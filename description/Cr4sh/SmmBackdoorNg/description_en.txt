This project is a UEFI System Management Mode backdoor framework with firmware and client-side components for low-level platform research.
It combines C-based DXE and SMM code with Python tooling for Windows and Linux interaction, deployment, and demonstrations.
The design supports multiple deployment paths, including flash-image infection and pre-boot DMA-assisted loading, and includes examples around privilege escalation and hypervisor interaction.
It is intended for firmware security research, persistence studies, and analysis of pre-OS attack surfaces.
