This project is an FPGA-based platform for autonomous pre-boot PCIe DMA attack workflows on compact hardware.
It combines Verilog HDL, Vivado and Vitis project assets, and embedded software running on a MicroBlaze soft processor.
The implementation supports autonomous payload execution as well as UART-controlled operation and SPI flashing for deployment flexibility.
Its primary use case is hardware-assisted boot and firmware security research, including DMA implant prototyping.
