This project is a curated resource index for Android AOSP and custom ROM development. It is primarily a Markdown knowledge base that organizes links for build systems, kernels, device trees, Treble, SELinux, debugging, and vendor-specific workflows. The collection emphasizes low-level platform engineering rather than app development and serves as a structured learning map. It is useful for mobile security and game security researchers who need deeper Android system internals context.
