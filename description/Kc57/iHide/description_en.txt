This project is an iOS jailbreak-hiding tweak that helps selected apps run as if the device were not jailbroken. It integrates with the iOS settings panel so users can enable or disable bypass behavior per application and attempts to defeat common jailbreak detection checks. The implementation uses MobileSubstrate style hooking with Objective-C and related iOS tweak components. It is mainly used in mobile app and game security testing where analysts need to evaluate behavior behind jailbreak detection gates.
