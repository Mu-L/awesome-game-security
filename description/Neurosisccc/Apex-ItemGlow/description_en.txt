This project is a minimal Apex Legends item-glow cheat snippet.
It is written in C++ and iterates through entity slots to write highlight values directly into memory.
The code is very small and focuses on a single wall-highlight style feature instead of a full cheat framework.
It is mainly useful as a quick proof of concept for memory-write based visual hacks.
