ROPium is a library and command-line tool for constructing return-oriented programming chains from binary gadgets. It automatically extracts and analyzes gadgets, then supports semantic queries to generate complex chains with less manual effort. The project combines a C++ core with Python bindings so workflows can be scripted or used interactively from a CLI. It is designed for exploit development research, binary security education, and advanced offensive tooling experiments.
