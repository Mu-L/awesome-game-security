This project is a Direct3D9 wrapper and proxy DLL framework with a built-in in-game overlay system. It is written in C++ and provides an on-screen console, text feed rendering, and a plugin interface for loading external feature modules. The codebase relies on DirectX 9 components and Detours-style interception to integrate into target applications. It is mainly intended for single-player game modding, UI instrumentation, and graphics overlay development.
