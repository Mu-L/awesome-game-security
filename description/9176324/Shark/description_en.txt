This project is a Windows kernel research toolkit focused on disabling PatchGuard behavior at runtime. It is implemented with C, C++, and assembly across x86 and x64 build targets, with scripts for Visual Studio and NMAKE workflows. The repository includes driver and loader components and references virtualization-assisted loading methods. Its primary audience is low-level security researchers investigating kernel defenses and PatchGuard bypass mechanics.
