Win32.Nebula is a proof-of-concept packed and protected module loader framework for Windows.
It is written mainly in C++ and separates a lightweight loader library from a builder utility that patches, encrypts, and packs binaries.
The design includes SDK-style APIs, a dynamic service manager concept, and low-level Windows internals oriented implementation choices.
Its main use case is research into software protection, loader architecture, and anti-analysis techniques used in malware and anti-cheat ecosystems.
