This project is an external cheat framework for Apex Legends.
It is implemented in C++ with an OpenGL and GLFW overlay stack, ImGui-based UI, and a custom driver-style memory access layer.
The feature set includes player and loot ESP, glow highlighting, aim assist with smoothing and FOV controls, recoil handling, bunny hop, and configurable visuals.
It is aimed at game security researchers studying external overlay architecture and memory-driven cheating techniques.
