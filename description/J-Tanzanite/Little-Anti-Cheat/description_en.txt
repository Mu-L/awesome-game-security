Little Anti-Cheat is an open-source SourceMod anti-cheat plugin for Source engine multiplayer servers.
Written in SourcePawn, it includes detections for aimbot and aimlock behavior, abnormal angles, bunnyhop automation, fast duck exploits, and suspicious ConVar states.
It also provides mitigation features such as interpolation and backtrack countermeasures, optional high-ping enforcement, and extensive logging and translation support.
The primary use case is community server administration for games like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike titles.
