This project is an automation setup for building an anti-detection variant of frida-server for Android. It tracks upstream Frida changes and applies a sequence of core patches that alter recognizable strings, pipes, symbols, and protocol behaviors. The repository is lightweight and centered on patch workflow rather than a large standalone codebase. It is aimed at mobile reverse engineering and anti-instrumentation research where standard Frida signatures are blocked.
