This project is a lightweight Linux hook base for CS:GO interface research. It is implemented in C++ and provides a minimal scaffold for loading a shared object and interacting with game interfaces. The repository focuses on structure and setup rather than a full feature heavy cheat framework. Its main use case is educational experimentation with Linux game internals and hook development.
