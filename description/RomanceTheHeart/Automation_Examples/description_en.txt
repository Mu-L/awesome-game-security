This project is an Unreal Engine 4 sample focused on editor automation utilities. It uses C++ Editor Utility classes with Blutility and EditorScriptingUtilities modules to automate tasks like renaming assets, duplicating assets, cleaning unused content, and organizing editor data. The repository also includes Blueprint utility assets and editor dashboard widgets designed for call-in-editor workflows. It is mainly intended for Unreal developers who want practical automation patterns for content pipeline tooling.
