MapleResearch is a community analysis document focused on the MapleStory v95.1 client internals.
The repository is mainly Markdown and walks through client structures, including anti-cheat related components such as CSecurityClient and its HackShield integration points.
It emphasizes practical reverse engineering notes for creating localhost environments rather than polished formal documentation.
The primary audience is game reverse engineers and private server researchers who need a starting map of client security logic.
