iOS Packager is a Python command-line utility for repackaging and signing iOS application bundles.
It parses certificate metadata, updates Info.plist and entitlements, retrieves provisioning profiles, and invokes codesign.
The project includes helper modules for provisioning requests, caching, and template-driven packaging steps.
It is useful for mobile app and game security workflows that require repeated resigning and deployment during testing.
