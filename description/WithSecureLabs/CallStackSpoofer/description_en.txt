This project is a proof-of-concept for spoofing arbitrary call stacks when issuing Windows system calls.
It is implemented in C++ and includes selectable sample stack profiles that imitate common process behaviors.
The repository also documents practical debugging and validation steps using telemetry and debugger workflows.
It is intended for security researchers studying EDR evasion techniques and stack-based detection logic.
