This project is a reverse engineered Counter-Strike 1.6 client adapted for platforms that the original game did not officially support, especially mobile devices. The codebase is mostly C/C++ and includes extensive engine, UI, audio, and asset integration work for cross platform builds. It is designed to run with the Xash3D FWGS ecosystem and existing game data from legitimate installs. Its main use case is game preservation, portability research, and engine level modding or reverse engineering.
