This project is a YOLO-based real-time aim-assist framework for FPS games that analyzes screen captures and drives automated aiming behavior. It is mainly written in Python and integrates Ultralytics inference with support for multiple model formats, including PyTorch weights, TensorRT engine files, and ONNX-based workflows. The codebase includes configurable aiming and trigger settings, multi-process capture and inference pipelines, and several input control backends such as Win32, Logitech DLL control, and kmNet. Its primary use case is game-security and cheat research around computer-vision-assisted targeting systems.
