This project is a Python-based save editor for Palworld that lets users edit and generate companion data entries.
It provides a desktop workflow for loading save files, modifying attributes, cloning entities, and writing updated data back to disk.
The repository includes source scripts, build helpers, and packaged assets for running directly or compiling a Windows executable.
Its primary use case is game save modding and controlled experimentation with structured save data formats.
