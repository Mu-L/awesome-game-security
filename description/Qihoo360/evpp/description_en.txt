This project is a high-performance C++11 network library for building event-driven TCP, UDP, and HTTP services.
It provides nonblocking server and client components, thread-safe event loops, timers, async DNS, and connection-oriented utility layers.
The codebase is built around libevent and includes production-focused tooling, benchmarks, and related clients for systems like Memcached and NSQ.
It is primarily intended for backend and infrastructure developers who need scalable low-latency network services.
