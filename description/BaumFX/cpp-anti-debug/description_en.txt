This project is a C++ anti-debugging library for Windows applications. It aggregates many checks including PEB and API-based debugger detection, exception-driven probes, timing measurements, and CPU/debug-register tests. The code offers both granular functions and a combined security check entry point for repeated runtime validation. The primary use case is anti-tamper prototyping and study of debugger detection techniques.
