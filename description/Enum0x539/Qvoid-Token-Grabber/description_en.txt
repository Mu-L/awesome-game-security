This project is a .NET-based credential and token grabbing toolkit focused on Discord and browser data collection.
It implements webhook-based exfiltration and bundles anti-analysis checks such as anti-debugging, anti-VM, anti-sandbox, and anti-emulation logic.
Key capabilities include Discord token harvesting, browser cookie and password extraction, screenshot capture, Wi-Fi password collection, and clipboard hijacking behavior.
Its primary use case is offensive security and malware-analysis research into information stealer techniques and account-token abuse workflows.
