This project is an Unreal Engine 5 C++ multiplayer shooter sample game named Blaster. It contains gameplay systems such as combat components, lag compensation, multiple weapon types, pickups, HUD widgets, team modes, and capture-the-flag logic. The repository also includes a multiplayer sessions plugin and Steam online subsystem configuration for networked play. It is primarily aimed at developers learning multiplayer game architecture, and it can also serve as a reference for game security researchers studying UE networking behavior.
