This project is a Windows DLL injector written in C++ around the SetWindowsHookExW injection method. It includes helper components for portable executable parsing, registry-related operations, and optional certificate spoofing workflows. The usage flow centers on selecting a payload DLL, setting a target window class, and running the injector against the chosen process. Its main use case is learning and testing user-mode injection pipelines in game security research contexts.
