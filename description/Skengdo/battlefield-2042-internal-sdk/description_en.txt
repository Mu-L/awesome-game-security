This project is an internal C++ SDK scaffold for Battlefield 2042 reverse engineering work. It exposes structures and helpers for entities, players, vehicles, weapons, game context, rendering access, and world-to-screen calculations. The repository is explicitly marked as incomplete, with notes about unresolved entity list iteration details. Its main use case is supporting internal tooling, debugging, and game security research prototypes.
