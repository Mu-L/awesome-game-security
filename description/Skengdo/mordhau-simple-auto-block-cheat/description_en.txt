This project is an internal C++ cheat module for Mordhau focused on automated melee defense and response behavior. It implements features such as auto-block for swings and kicks plus optional auto-stab logic, and it is intended to be injected into the game process. A very large generated SDK is included, showing heavy reliance on Unreal Engine class and function dump headers. The primary audience is game hacking researchers exploring combat automation techniques and internal module structure.
