This project is an external C++ tool for dumping, reading, and editing active mission variables in Arma 3. It includes memory-management and game-specific helper code intended to locate variables and modify values such as server economy fields. The usage notes target servers with BattlEye disabled and state that online use requires additional bypass logic. The primary use case is game hacking research and tooling experiments around Arma 3 runtime data manipulation.
