This project is a proof of concept that hides an overlay window handle from window enumeration by manipulating kernel-side window structures.
It uses a Windows kernel driver plus user-mode test programs to locate and modify win32k related pointers and TAGWND-linked data.
The code focuses on DKOM-style techniques and includes examples for triggering the behavior from a DirectX overlay context.
It is intended for low-level Windows internals research around overlay visibility and anti-cheat evasion mechanics.
