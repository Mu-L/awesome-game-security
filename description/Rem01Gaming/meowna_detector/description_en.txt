This project is a proof-of-concept Android detector for root-hiding modules that disrupt logging services.
It checks indicators such as missing logd sockets and package traces to flag suspicious environment tampering behavior.
The implementation is a small C program built with Android NDK makefiles.
It is intended for mobile security testing and for studying how fragile root-hiding techniques can become detectable.
