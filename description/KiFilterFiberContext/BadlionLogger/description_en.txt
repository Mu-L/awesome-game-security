This project is a proof-of-concept kernel logger for observing a game anti-cheat driver at runtime. It applies IAT hooks during image load callbacks to monitor behavior in a black-box manner, specifically against a VMProtect-virtualized target module. The implementation is mainly C++ with a focus on kernel callback handling and instrumentation rather than production robustness. It is intended for anti-cheat research and educational study of driver-level monitoring techniques.
