This project is a GUI-based patching tool for modifying .NET assemblies. It is written in C# and uses libraries such as dnlib and Harmony to map patch methods to target methods across many method types. The application supports importing/exporting patch sets, optional password protection for patch files, and workflows for packed or obfuscated managed binaries. The primary use case is reverse-engineering research and repeatable .NET patch automation.
