This project is a Unity 3D first-person movement example that implements mouse look, movement, jumping, dashing, and crouching. It is written in C# scripts intended to be attached to a player object with Rigidbody and Collider components. The README documents setup steps, control bindings, and known behavior issues such as dash sliding. It is mainly a beginner-friendly gameplay prototype for learning FPS controller mechanics in Unity.
