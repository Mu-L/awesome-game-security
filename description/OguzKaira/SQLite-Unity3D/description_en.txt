This project is a Unity C# example that stores and restores player coordinates using an SQLite database. It provides a simple DatabaseManager workflow to save position data and load it during gameplay with keyboard shortcuts. The code demonstrates integrating an SQLite file in StreamingAssets and mapping basic game-state values to persistent storage. It is intended for learners who want a lightweight save and load foundation in Unity projects.
