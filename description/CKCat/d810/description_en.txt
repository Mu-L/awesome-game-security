This project is an IDA Pro plugin for deobfuscation at decompilation time by rewriting microcode. It is primarily written in Python and is built to be integrated into normal reverse-engineering workflows with configurable rule sets. The framework is designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add new deobfuscation logic without heavily modifying core code. It is mainly used by malware and game-security analysts who need clearer pseudocode from heavily obfuscated binaries.
