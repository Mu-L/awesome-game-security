Kiteshield is a Linux x86-64 ELF packer and protector designed to make binaries harder to reverse engineer. It wraps executables with layered RC4 encryption and injects a custom loader that decrypts, maps, and runs code entirely in user space. Its runtime engine uses ptrace to keep only functions in the active call stack decrypted and adds multiple anti-debugging checks during execution. The project is written mainly in C with assembly helpers and serves as an educational platform for binary obfuscation and anti-analysis research.
