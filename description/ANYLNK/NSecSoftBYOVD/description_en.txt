This project is a bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver proof of concept for process termination. It uses a Windows executable and a vulnerable third-party driver to perform privileged actions against a target PID. The repository frames the technique in the context of real-world abuse patterns and references its assigned CVE entry. It is primarily relevant to Windows kernel security research, offensive tooling analysis, and anti-cheat or endpoint defense hardening.
