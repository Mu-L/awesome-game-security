OpenGraphic is a curated knowledge base of open-source graphics and game engine resources. The repository is maintained as Markdown indexes that group projects by engines, rendering techniques, optimization topics, tools, and tutorials. It aggregates references across vendor ecosystems and community frameworks to provide a broad technical landscape. Its primary use case is technology scouting and study for graphics programmers, engine developers, and researchers.
