BigWhiteTool is an Android native game memory utility focused on Unreal-style metadata discovery and SDK dumping. The C and C++ codebase includes modules for process memory read and write, GName and GObject based offset traversal, and dump generation logic. It also bundles an ImGui interface with Vulkan or OpenGL rendering paths and NDK-based CMake build support. The project is mainly used in mobile game reverse engineering workflows for offset finding, runtime inspection, and SDK extraction.
