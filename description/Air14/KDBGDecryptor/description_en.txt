This project is a Windows kernel-mode sample that demonstrates how to decrypt the kernel debugger data block (KDBG). It is implemented in C++ as a Visual Studio driver project and uses native kernel internals such as KdDecodeBlockData. The code shows two techniques: direct API-assisted decoding and manual decryption using KiWaitNever and KiWaitAlways values copied from memory for a stealthier workflow. It is mainly useful for kernel reverse engineering, low-level debugging research, and studying anti-cheat related memory analysis paths.
