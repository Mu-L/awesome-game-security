This project is a lightweight scanner that searches directories for vulnerable Windows drivers.
It is implemented as a small C++ command-line utility intended for quick triage of driver files.
The tool helps identify potential bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver exposure in common system driver locations.
It is useful for anti-cheat bypass research, incident response, and defensive security audits.
