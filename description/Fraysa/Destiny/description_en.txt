Destiny is an open-source C# server emulator for MapleStory v0.83. It provides a multi-server architecture with center, login, and game components, plus Lua scripting support for NPC and portal behaviors. The codebase is organized as a Visual Studio solution and relies on SQL-backed game data for account and world state management. Its primary use case is private server development and MMORPG protocol or gameplay research.
