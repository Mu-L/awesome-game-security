This project is an external Windows game cheat framework that pairs a kernel driver with a user-mode client for rendering and control.
It is primarily implemented in C and C++, and documents a bypass path based on hooking a kernel call chain and exchanging data through shared memory.
Feature modules include ESP entities, recoil control, automation options, and other gameplay state manipulations.
Its primary use case is reverse-engineering and anti-cheat evasion research around kernel hooks and overlay techniques.
