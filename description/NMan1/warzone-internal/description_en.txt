This project is an internal cheat DLL for Modern Warfare and Warzone that hooks the game's rendering flow.
It implements ESP, aimbot, and recoil control features with an ImGui-based in-game menu and DX12 present-hook rendering.
The implementation is mainly C++ with assembly syscall stubs and custom utility and game abstraction layers.
It is intended as a base for reverse engineering and cheat feature prototyping in competitive shooter environments.
