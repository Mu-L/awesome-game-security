This project is an external Call of Duty: Warzone cheat framework built around a manually mapped kernel driver.
It combines user-mode memory access with an overlay hijacking approach to render ESP visuals and related on-screen features.
The codebase is primarily C++ with separate client and driver Visual Studio projects, plus game SDK and offset scaffolding.
It is aimed at game hacking and anti-cheat research on driver-assisted external tooling.
