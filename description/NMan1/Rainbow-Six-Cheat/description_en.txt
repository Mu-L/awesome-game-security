This project is a full-source Windows cheat framework that combines a kernel driver, an external menu, and shared-memory communication.
It is largely implemented in C and C++ and includes loader logic, rendering components, and gameplay manipulation modules.
The documented capabilities cover ESP and chams visuals, silent-aim and recoil or spread controls, unlock and movement modifications, and configurable settings.
Its main use case is game hacking research and analysis of kernel-assisted cheat designs from an anti-cheat perspective.
