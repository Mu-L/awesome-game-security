This project is a second-generation external cheat framework for a Windows shooter, paired with a kernel-mode driver bypass.
It is written in C and C++ and uses an inline kernel function hook strategy with a user-mode menu and rendering components.
The codebase includes combat and visual features such as aimbot, chams, rapid fire, recoil and spread edits, and speed or FOV controls.
Its main use case is studying kernel-assisted cheat architecture and anti-cheat detection tradeoffs.
