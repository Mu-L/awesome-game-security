This project is an internal Windows game modification framework that combines a kernel injector with a manually mapped user-mode DLL.
It is mostly implemented in C and C++ with Direct3D11 rendering and menu code for in-game controls.
The feature set includes ESP visuals, aimbot logic, recoil and spread manipulation, movement and FOV adjustments, and other gameplay modifications.
Its primary use case is reverse-engineering and anti-cheat research into kernel-assisted injection and detection surfaces.
