This project is a web-based crosshair generator for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It uses JavaScript with jQuery, jQuery UI, and KineticJS plus HTML and CSS assets to let users preview and tune crosshair parameters visually. The tool can generate ready-to-use config values, includes presets, and supports custom keybind-related setup. Its primary use case is helping players and modding enthusiasts quickly design and share crosshair configurations.
