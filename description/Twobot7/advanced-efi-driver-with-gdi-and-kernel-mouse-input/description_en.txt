This project is a UEFI-based memory access and process manipulation framework for Windows environments. It is written in C and C++ and combines driver-level memory operations with an overlay renderer and high-frequency input handling components. The repository advertises stealth and hardening features such as encrypted command channels, anti-detection logic, and security-oriented validation paths. Its primary use case is advanced game security experimentation involving low-level access, overlay rendering, and input automation.
