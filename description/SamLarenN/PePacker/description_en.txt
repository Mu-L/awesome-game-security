This project is a simple PE packer that encrypts the .text section of Windows executables and appends a decryption stub.
It is implemented in C++ with custom PE parsing components for exploring and rewriting sections.
The default protection method uses XOR encryption as a lightweight demonstration that can be replaced with stronger algorithms.
It is mainly useful for reverse engineering practice, packer development learning, and basic obfuscation research in game security contexts.
