This project is an unofficial VS Code extension that provides a Frida workbench for mobile instrumentation. It integrates target selection, script editing and dispatch, REPL workflows, device log viewing, and helper tooling for iOS and Android sessions. The extension is built mainly with TypeScript and Python integration points, and is designed to work with frida-tools and common mobile connectivity utilities. It targets mobile security researchers and reverse engineers who want to run Frida workflows directly inside an IDE.
