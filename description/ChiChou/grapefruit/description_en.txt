This project is a Frida-powered runtime exploration toolkit for mobile applications with a web-based interface. It offers method hooking, crypto API interception, filesystem and SQLite inspection, log streaming, crash reporting, and platform-specific capabilities for both iOS and Android. The stack is mainly TypeScript and combines backend instrumentation services with a rich frontend for interactive analysis. It also includes specialized mobile security features such as keychain and keystore inspection, traffic capture, Java and Objective-C introspection, and environment manipulation. The primary use case is mobile app security testing, reverse engineering, and dynamic analysis workflows.
