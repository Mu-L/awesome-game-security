This project is a compact C++ anti-analysis toolkit intended to reduce the effectiveness of runtime inspection. It offers modules such as string obfuscation, anti-step-over logic, software and hardware breakpoint checks, .text integrity checks, return-address manipulation, and system DLL unhooking. The components are designed to be integrated selectively into existing codebases with minimal friction. It is primarily used in offensive security research and anti-tamper experimentation where evasion of dynamic analysis is being studied.
