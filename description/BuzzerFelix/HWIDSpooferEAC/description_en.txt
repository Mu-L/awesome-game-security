This project is a Windows HWID spoofing toolkit that combines an ImGui-based user interface with kernel-driver loading components. The codebase is primarily C++ and includes modules related to driver mapping, service handling, and low-level hardware identifier changes. It targets practical testing scenarios where users want to trigger machine identity changes through a GUI workflow. The main audience is game bypass and anti-cheat research users exploring HWID-based enforcement.
