This project is a collection of Frida instrumentation scripts for dynamic analysis across mobile and desktop platforms. It includes tracing and enumeration helpers for iOS, Android, and Linux, along with reusable snippets for common runtime hook scenarios. The scripts are written in JavaScript for Frida and cover tasks such as method tracing, class discovery, and bypass-oriented experimentation. It is primarily used by reverse engineers and application security testers during live runtime analysis.
