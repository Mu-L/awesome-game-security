This project is a C# process injection toolkit that supports multiple execution techniques in one command-line program.
It implements methods such as vanilla injection, DLL injection, process hollowing, APC queue injection, and KernelCallbackTable injection.
The tool supports P/Invoke, D/Invoke, direct and indirect syscalls, multiple shellcode input formats, optional encryption, and parent PID spoofing.
Its main use case is offensive security research, detection engineering validation, and controlled lab analysis of injection tradecraft.
