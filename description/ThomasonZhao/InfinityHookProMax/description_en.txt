This project is a Windows kernel hooking framework derived from earlier InfinityHook variants. It is implemented in C++ as a driver-oriented codebase and includes low-level hook management and instruction-disassembly components. The repository emphasizes broader compatibility and stability, with testing targets spanning multiple Windows versions in virtualized environments. Its main use case is kernel security research, including anti-cheat and system monitoring experimentation.
