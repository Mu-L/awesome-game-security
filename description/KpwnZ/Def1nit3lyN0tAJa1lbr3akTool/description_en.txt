This project is an iOS jailbreak tool targeting devices on iOS 16.0 through 16.6.1.
It builds on modern community jailbreak and kernel exploitation research and includes build steps for different trustcache versions.
The codebase contains low-level iOS components, extensive native headers, and Xcode plus make-based build workflows.
Primary implementation languages are Objective-C and C-family native code.
It is aimed at advanced iOS security researchers and jailbreak developers studying post-exploitation workflows.
