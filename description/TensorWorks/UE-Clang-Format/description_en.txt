This project provides a Clang-Format configuration tuned for Unreal Engine C++ coding style.
It includes guidance for applying the format file in editors such as VS Code and for enabling consistent formatting in day-to-day development.
The repository is lightweight and mainly configuration and documentation, centered on C++ formatting rules rather than engine code.
Its main use case is keeping Unreal codebases aligned with Epic-style conventions across teams.
