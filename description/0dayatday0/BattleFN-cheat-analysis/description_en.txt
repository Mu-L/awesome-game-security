This project is a technical analysis package focused on a detected Fortnite cheat implementation. It contains a written analysis, sample cheat modules, and proof-of-concept tooling for manual driver mapping and privileged process memory access. The practical components are implemented with batch scripts and C++ code to demonstrate user-mode to kernel-mode interaction paths. It is primarily aimed at anti-cheat researchers and reverse engineers investigating real-world cheat tradecraft and mistakes.
