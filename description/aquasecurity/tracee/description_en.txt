This project is a Linux runtime security and observability platform built on eBPF event collection. It is implemented primarily in Go and combines low-level kernel telemetry with higher-level detections for suspicious behavioral patterns. The codebase includes container and Kubernetes deployment paths, extensive detection content, and tooling for production-scale monitoring. It is aimed at cloud and host security teams performing threat detection, incident response, and runtime forensics.
