Gemini-Genius is a Python toolkit for binary function similarity analysis using graph-based embeddings.
It combines dataset preprocessing scripts, model training code, and inference utilities that operate on CFG and ACFG representations extracted with IDA.
The workflow covers graph generation, embedding export, and similarity search between candidate functions.
It is intended for reverse engineering and vulnerability research use cases such as cross-binary function matching.
