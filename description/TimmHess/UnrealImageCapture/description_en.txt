This project demonstrates how to capture Unreal Engine images to disk for machine learning workflows. It uses Unreal C++ code to perform high-FPS frame capture without blocking the render or main game threads. The implementation covers synchronized RGB output, segmentation masks, and depth capture, with configuration guidance for formats and engine build dependencies. Its main use case is generating annotated synthetic datasets from UE scenes for computer vision and simulation research.
