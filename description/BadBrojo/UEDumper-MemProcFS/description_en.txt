This project is an all-in-one Unreal Engine dumper and live editor for runtime SDK extraction and memory inspection. It is written in C++ with an ImGui-based interface and supports a wide range of Unreal Engine versions through configurable offsets and engine definitions. The codebase includes modules for SDK generation, class browsing, live read/write operations, and integration with MemProcFS/LeechCore-style memory backends. The primary use case is Unreal game reverse engineering and game security analysis.
