This project is an iOS Unreal Engine dumper delivered as a MobileSubstrate tweak.
Its codebase is mainly C++ and Objective-C++, targeting arm64 and arm64e devices with pattern-based discovery of core engine structures.
It can dump offsets, classes, structs, enums, and functions, then generate analysis-ready symbol JSON for tools like IDA and Ghidra.
The primary use case is iOS game reverse engineering and Unreal Engine security research on mobile titles.
