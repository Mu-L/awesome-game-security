This project is a runtime memory patching library for Android and iOS applications.
It is implemented in C++ and provides utilities for memory scanning, pointer validation, file helpers, and code patch creation.
The library integrates with Keystone assembler for assembly-based patch generation and includes prebuilt binaries and platform-specific examples.
It is commonly used in mobile game reverse engineering and security research when controlled in-memory modification is required.
