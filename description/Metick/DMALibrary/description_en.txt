DMALibrary is a C++ toolkit that provides broad DMA functionality for external memory access and system inspection.
It includes signature scanning, normal and scatter read and write operations, memory dumping, CR3 fixing helpers, PID and base lookup, and utility routines for import or export parsing.
The implementation is designed to integrate with common DMA ecosystem libraries such as LeechCore and MemProcFS dependencies.
Its primary use case is advanced game security research and cheat tooling that relies on hardware DMA paths.
