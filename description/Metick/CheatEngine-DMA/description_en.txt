CheatEngine-DMA is a Visual Studio C++ plugin that adds DMA-backed memory operations to Cheat Engine workflows.
It implements practical features such as process attach, memory read and write, memory search and browsing, module and thread enumeration, and pointer scanning support.
The project combines a plugin layer with DMA support components to expose low-level access through familiar Cheat Engine interfaces.
It targets DMA users and game memory researchers who want external hardware-assisted analysis and editing capabilities.
