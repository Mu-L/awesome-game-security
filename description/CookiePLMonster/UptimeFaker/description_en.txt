This project is a Windows timing hook library that fakes system uptime values for testing and compatibility work.
It is written in C++ as a Detours-based plugin and can be injected as a DLL or ASI-style module.
The tool can redirect multiple timer-related APIs and applies configurable behavior through an INI file, including process-relative time simulation.
It is primarily used to diagnose or mitigate game and application bugs that appear on high-uptime systems.
