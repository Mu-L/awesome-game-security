This project is an IDA plugin for IoT firmware vulnerability hunting based on tracing arguments into sensitive functions. It is primarily written in Python and combines static checks with debugger-assisted dynamic analysis to reduce manual triage effort. The documented rules target issues like buffer overflows, command execution risks, and format string problems, with automation support through command-line batch workflows. Its main use case is firmware security auditing and reverse engineering research on embedded targets.
