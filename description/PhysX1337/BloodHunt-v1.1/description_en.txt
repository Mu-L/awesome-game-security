This project is an external Windows cheat framework built around memory reading and overlay rendering for an Unreal Engine shooter. The C++ implementation uses DirectX9 and ImGui to provide ESP visuals, configurable aimbot behavior, and recoil-related modifications through runtime memory access. It includes hardcoded game offsets, actor caching logic, and on-screen menu controls for feature toggling and tuning. The repository is mainly used for cheat prototyping and anti-cheat evasion research.
