This project is a universal graphics API hooking library for Windows games.
It supports Direct3D 9 through 12, OpenGL, and Vulkan, and pairs with MinHook to bind function detours by method-table index.
The code is written in C++ and includes method tables and sample ImGui integrations for overlay rendering.
It is commonly used in game security research and tooling to intercept rendering pipelines and build debug or overlay features.
