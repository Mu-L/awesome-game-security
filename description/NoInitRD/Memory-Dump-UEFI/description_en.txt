This project is a UEFI application for dumping physical RAM from a live-boot environment.
It is written in C with UEFI build tooling and is designed to run from USB media alongside a UEFI shell.
The repository includes scripts, build artifacts, and documentation for collecting memory images on modern systems.
It is mainly used for forensic acquisition and low-level security research where offline memory capture is required.
