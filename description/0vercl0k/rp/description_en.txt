This project is a fast gadget-finding utility for return-oriented programming analysis. It targets PE, ELF, and Mach-O binaries across x86, x64, ARM, and ARM64, and can search both instruction gadgets and useful pointer values. The implementation is primarily in C++ with cross-platform build support and integrated disassembly-related dependencies. It is intended for exploit developers and reverse engineers building ROP chains and auditing binary attack surfaces.
