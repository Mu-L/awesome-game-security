This project is a distributed snapshot-based fuzzer for Windows and experimental Linux targets. It combines coverage-guided fuzzing with multiple execution backends, including emulator and virtualization-driven snapshot execution for user-mode and kernel-mode scenarios. The codebase is largely C++ with auxiliary scripts and tooling for corpus handling, coverage processing, and trace-oriented workflows. It is aimed at vulnerability researchers fuzzing complex software such as game components, drivers, and system services.
