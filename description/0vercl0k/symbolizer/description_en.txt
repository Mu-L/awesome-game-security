This project is a Windows execution-trace symbolizer that resolves raw instruction pointers to symbolic locations. It uses dbgeng and crash dump data to translate trace addresses into readable function-level output for analysis. The implementation is in C++ and packaged as a command-line tool with supporting libraries for formatting and argument handling. It is mainly useful for crash triage, exploit debugging, and postmortem trace workflows.
