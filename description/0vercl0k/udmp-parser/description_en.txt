This project is a cross-platform C++ parser for Windows user-mode minidump files. It provides access to thread data, register contexts, virtual memory ranges, and loaded modules through library APIs and a parser utility. The repository includes CMake build files, tests, and optional Python bindings for automation. It is useful for debugger tooling, reverse engineering, and incident-response dump triage.
