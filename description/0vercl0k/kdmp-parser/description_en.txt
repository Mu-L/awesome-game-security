This project is a C++ parsing library and toolset for Windows kernel crash dumps. It supports full and active dump formats and exposes data such as context records, exception information, bugcheck parameters, and physical memory views. The codebase includes a parser CLI, automated tests, CMake build scripts, and optional Python bindings for scripting workflows. It is designed for low-level crash forensics, kernel debugging automation, and exploitation research.
