This project is an in-game overlay and system tuning toolkit focused on gaming performance telemetry. It is largely C/C++ and includes rendering and hook modules for Direct3D 8/9/10/11, DXGI, and related Windows graphics paths. Core features include OSD metrics for CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage activity, plus options such as frame limiting and synchronization control. The main use case is real-time performance monitoring and overlay experimentation during gameplay.
