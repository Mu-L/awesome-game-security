This project is a compact virtual-machine detection component intended to be embedded into Windows C++ applications. It is a smaller derivative inspired by pafish and focuses on lightweight anti-virtualization checks rather than a full research suite. The implementation prioritizes easy integration in Visual C++ environments with minimal footprint. Its primary use case is anti-analysis experimentation and quick environment fingerprinting in security-oriented tooling.
