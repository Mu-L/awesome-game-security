This project is a Windows kernel proof of concept for manually mapping a driver into a discarded section of a legitimate driver image. It demonstrates creating a system thread after boot while attempting to avoid immediate PatchGuard-triggered detection. The implementation is centered on C-based driver development with supporting loader and structure code. It is intended for advanced kernel stealth loading experiments in authorized anti-cheat and security research environments.
