This project demonstrates low-level mouse event injection through the undocumented NtUserInjectMouseInput syscall. It is implemented in C++ with custom input structures and a small interface layer for movement and click actions. The approach provides an alternative to higher-level input simulation APIs and highlights Windows internals relevant to input paths. It is mainly useful for automation research, input emulation tooling, and cheat-adjacent experimentation.
