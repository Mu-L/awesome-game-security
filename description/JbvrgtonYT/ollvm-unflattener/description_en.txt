This project is an OLLVM unflattening tool that aims to recover clearer control flow from obfuscated programs. It is implemented primarily in Python and uses reverse engineering dependencies such as miasm and graph visualization tooling. The repository includes sample binaries and test inputs for experimenting with deobfuscation behavior. Its main use case is reverse engineering research on control-flow-flattened software.
