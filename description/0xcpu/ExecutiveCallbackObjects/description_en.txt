This project is a research collection focused on Windows executive callback objects and their runtime behavior. It combines technical notes with C-based kernel proof-of-concept samples that register, inspect, and analyze callback activity. The material spans multiple callback families across networking, system state, boot flow, and security-related components. It is mainly useful for Windows internals research, telemetry visibility studies, and anti-cheat or EDR-oriented analysis.
