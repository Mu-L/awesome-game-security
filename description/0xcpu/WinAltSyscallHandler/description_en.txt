This project is a Windows kernel research proof of concept exploring alternate system call handler mechanics. It explains handler registration limits, dispatch conditions, and how thread debug flags influence which callback path is executed. The implementation includes C code and experiments around trap frame usage and process information calls needed to enable monitoring. It is aimed at low-level security researchers studying syscall interception behavior and related stability constraints.
