BWSR is a cross-platform inline hooking library for Arm64 and Arm64e devices. It is implemented in C and targets iOS, Android, Linux, and macOS environments for runtime code interception. The project focuses on low-level patching primitives and includes build paths for multiple mobile and desktop platforms. It is intended for security researchers and systems developers who need portable hook-based instrumentation in native binaries.
