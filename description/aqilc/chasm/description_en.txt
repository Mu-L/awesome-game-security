This project is a high-performance runtime x86-64 assembler library written in C. It provides an instruction IR, fast assembly and execution helpers, relative reference linking, rich operand macros, and debugging utilities such as IR stringification. The library supports many x86 extensions including AVX-256 and is designed for very low-latency dynamic code generation workloads. It is best suited for JIT compilers, emulators, runtime optimization, and systems research.
