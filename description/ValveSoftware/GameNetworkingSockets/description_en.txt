This project is a cross-platform game networking transport library that provides reliable and unreliable messaging over a connection-oriented API.
It is implemented mainly in C++ with C interfaces, CMake builds, and support for desktop, mobile, and console environments.
Major features include fragmentation and reassembly, advanced packet reliability with ack vectors, bandwidth lane control, and detailed network simulation tools.
It also provides encrypted transport and peer-to-peer connectivity with NAT traversal support, making it suitable for multiplayer game backend and engine networking.
