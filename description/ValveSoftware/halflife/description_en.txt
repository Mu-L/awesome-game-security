This project is the Half-Life 1 engine and SDK source code used to build and modify classic GoldSrc-based games.
The codebase is primarily C and C++ and includes client, server, shared engine interfaces, and platform-specific build assets.
It documents modern build workflows for Windows and Linux while preserving the original modding-oriented architecture.
Its main audience is mod developers and engine researchers who need direct access to gameplay code and legacy engine internals.
