This project is an Android implementation of an ImGui-based menu framework for Unity IL2CPP games. It combines C++ native code with Android build tooling and documents packaging steps in Android Studio. The workflow centers on producing native libraries and integrating them into target APK architectures for in-game UI rendering. It is primarily intended for mobile game modding and cheat UI prototyping in IL2CPP environments.
