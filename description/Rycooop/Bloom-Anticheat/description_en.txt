This project is a multi-component Windows x64 anti-cheat prototype that combines kernel and user-mode protections. Its driver layer uses callback mechanisms such as ObRegisterCallbacks to protect the anti-cheat process and target process from hostile handle operations. The repository includes supporting DLL and application code, plus build setup for Visual Studio projects. It is intended for anti-cheat experimentation and for studying practical tradeoffs between kernel callbacks and user-mode monitoring.
