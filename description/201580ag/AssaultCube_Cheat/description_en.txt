This project is a collection of AssaultCube cheat practice code covering multiple game versions.
It includes internal and external implementations with common FPS cheat features such as aimbot, ESP, overlays, memory utilities, and offset handling examples.
The codebase mixes C/C++, C#, and supporting scripts, and uses tooling such as ImGui, OpenGL hooks, and memory editing workflows.
It is primarily aimed at learners who want hands-on experience with game hacking and reverse engineering techniques in a controlled training context.
