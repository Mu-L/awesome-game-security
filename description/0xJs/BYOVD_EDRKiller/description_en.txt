This project is an educational Windows BYOVD proof of concept that abuses a vulnerable signed driver to terminate selected security processes. It documents reverse engineering of the driver interface, including device naming, IOCTL selection, and required input buffer structure. The C implementation automates driver deployment, target process enumeration, repeated termination attempts, and cleanup on exit. It is aimed at authorized red-team style research on defensive product resilience and kernel attack surface.
