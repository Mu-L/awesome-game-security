This project is an archived Gradle plugin intended to simplify building Ghidra extensions. It configures classpaths from a local Ghidra installation, wires in extension build scripts, and includes helper tasks for IDE setup. The implementation is mainly Java and Groovy and focuses on developer ergonomics around extension packaging. It is most relevant for reverse-engineering tool developers who maintain custom Ghidra plugins.
