This project is a Ghidra extension focused on PlayStation 4 Orbis binaries and related firmware artifacts. It includes loaders, analyzers, scripts, syscall data, and NID mapping resources to improve symbol recovery and platform-specific analysis. The code is Java and Gradle based and integrates with Ghidra's extension model while optionally pairing with additional C++ class analysis tooling. Its primary use case is console reverse engineering and game security research on PS4 software.
