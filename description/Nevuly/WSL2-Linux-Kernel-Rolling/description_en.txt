This project provides rolling stable Linux kernel builds and configuration guidance for WSL2.
It is driven by Markdown documentation and CI automation that rebuilds when newer stable kernel releases appear.
The repository includes build instructions for both x86 and ARM64 targets and emphasizes reproducible kernel workflows.
It is intended for WSL2 users and low-level developers who need up-to-date kernels for testing and research.
