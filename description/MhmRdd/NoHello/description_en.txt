NoHello is a Zygisk-based Android module designed to hide root and Zygisk-related artifacts from target apps.
The project combines native code and Android build tooling, and adds configurable behaviors such as blacklist or whitelist modes and mount-rule driven unmount logic.
Documentation covers usage across Magisk, KernelSU, APatch, and related Zygisk variants with practical setup guidance.
It is aimed at mobile security and anti-cheat bypass researchers who test root-detection resistance in app environments.
