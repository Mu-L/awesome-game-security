This project is a legacy MapleStory bot framework for automated gameplay tasks. It combines C++ and C# components with resource files that include map and portal data used by the bot logic. The README notes the project was discontinued and that some major logic pieces are not included in the published state. It is best suited for historical reverse engineering and study of older game bot design patterns.
