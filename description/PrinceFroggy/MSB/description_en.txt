This project is a legacy MapleStory trainer toolkit from an earlier era of the game. The codebase mixes C++ trainer components with a C# launcher and Visual Studio project structure. It includes modules related to injection and runtime control, with the README describing historical effectiveness for specific game versions. It is mainly useful as a historical reference for researchers studying older MMO trainer architecture.
