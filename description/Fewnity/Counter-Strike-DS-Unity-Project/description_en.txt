This project is a Unity tooling workspace used to support development of a Nintendo DS Counter-Strike demake. It provides map and gameplay data export workflows for collisions, stairs, culling zones, shadow zones, bomb zones, and trigger data. It also includes tools to generate pathfinding waypoints and matrices, plus a scene-based pipeline for exporting gun sprites. The primary use case is helping game developers maintain and iterate DS-compatible content and logic outside the core game codebase.
