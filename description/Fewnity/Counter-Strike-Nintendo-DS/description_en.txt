This project is a Counter-Strike demake for Nintendo DS with online multiplayer support on emulator and real hardware. It is implemented in C for the devkitPro and Nitro Engine toolchain and includes game systems for weapons, bots, maps, and networking. The codebase is paired with practical setup instructions for DS-family devices, emulator networking, and source builds. Its main use case is homebrew FPS development and technical experimentation on constrained handheld hardware.
