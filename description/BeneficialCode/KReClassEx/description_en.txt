This project is a kernel memory structure reversing environment that combines a WinDbg extension with a desktop GUI. It allows users to connect to a debug session, inspect kernel memory layouts, resolve function pointers, and generate reconstructed type views. The codebase is primarily C++ and includes networking/configuration components plus editor integrations for interactive analysis workflows. The primary use case is Windows kernel reverse engineering and game anti-cheat research.
