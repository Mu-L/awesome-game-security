This project is an open-source Windows anti-rootkit and low-level system analysis platform. It contains a large C++ ecosystem of drivers, kernel libraries, symbol and PE parsers, monitoring modules, and investigation-oriented UI components. The toolchain targets modern Windows versions and is designed to stay effective by working with symbol infrastructure and deep kernel/user-mode inspection paths. The primary use case is security research, rootkit hunting, and anti-cheat internals analysis.
