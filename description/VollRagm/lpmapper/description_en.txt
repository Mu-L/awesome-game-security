This project is a Windows kernel mapper that places shellcode into already loaded large-page drivers without fresh memory allocation. It is implemented in C++ and follows a workflow inspired by known manual mappers while requiring specific registry configuration for large-page drivers. The technique is framed as a method to reduce visibility to common kernel anti-cheat detection paths. Its main use case is advanced kernel security research and anti-cheat bypass experimentation.
