This project is a Windows utility for live inspection of process page tables through a driver plus graphical client. It combines C++ kernel-side components with a C# interface to browse entries, dump physical pages, and inspect PTE metadata. The tool also supports virtual-to-physical translation workflows and large page awareness for deeper memory mapping analysis. Its primary use case is low-level OS memory research, debugging, and anti-cheat oriented kernel investigations.
