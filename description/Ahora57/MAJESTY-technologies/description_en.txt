This project is an experimental Windows kernel driver focused on anti-debugging and anti-analysis protections. It uses low-level C/C++ techniques, including DKOM-style structure manipulation, instrumentation callback checks, hardware breakpoint checks, and process/thread flag hardening. The implementation also explores anti-hypervisor timing and anomaly checks while documenting additional planned kernel-user communication features. It is intended for anti-cheat and protection research where kernel-level detection and debugger resistance are being studied.
