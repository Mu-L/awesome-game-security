This project is a small proof-of-concept anti-anti-debug tool that explores race-condition-based bypass behavior. It is implemented in C++ for Visual Studio and uses native Windows NT APIs to probe debug ports, hidden-thread behavior, and related debugger artifacts. The sample focuses on demonstrating how timing and state checks can be used against common hiding mechanisms in userland debugging scenarios. Its primary audience is reverse engineering researchers experimenting with anti-debug and anti-anti-debug techniques.
