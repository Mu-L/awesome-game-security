This project is an archived internal cheat base for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
It is written mainly in C++ and built with Visual Studio as a DLL that can be injected into the game process.
The code includes common modules such as ESP, glow effects, triggerbot, bunny hop, third-person view, and world-to-screen math, with an ImGui and DirectX9 menu layer.
It is primarily useful as a learning reference for researchers studying how internal cheats are structured and extended.
