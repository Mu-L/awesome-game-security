AntiDBG is a curated collection of Windows anti-debugging techniques implemented for learning and practical testing. It groups checks by method, including memory structure inspection, CPU and timing tricks, forced exceptions, and other debugger detection approaches. The codebase uses C/C++ with x86 and x64 assembly and includes a gauntlet-style test application that runs checks in sequence. It is best suited for reverse engineering education, software protection research, and evaluating anti-analysis defenses in game security contexts.
