This project is a C++ framework for driver-assisted process memory operations and module mapping.
It defines a request-based communication layer for reading, writing, allocation, protection changes, and module queries.
The sample workflow includes extending mapped modules and triggering execution through hijacked API call paths.
It is intended for advanced experimentation in memory manipulation, injection research, and game security analysis.
