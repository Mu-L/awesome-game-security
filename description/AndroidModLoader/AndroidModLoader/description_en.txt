This project is a native Android mod loader framework for injecting and managing mods in games and applications. It is primarily written in C++ with Android NDK build scripts and includes patching, memory writing, function hooking, and interface-based mod APIs. The codebase bundles supporting components for ARM hooking, dependency handling, IL2CPP-oriented utilities, and mod template scaffolding. It targets game mod developers and reverse engineers building runtime modifications on Android.
