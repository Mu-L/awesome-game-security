This project is a simple external cheat implementation for Fortnite. It relies on offset updates and external process interaction patterns, making it a lightweight example of out-of-process game manipulation. The repository is written mainly in C++ and organized as a Visual Studio project with typical external cheat structure. It is intended for learning and experimentation in game hacking and anti-cheat interaction analysis.
