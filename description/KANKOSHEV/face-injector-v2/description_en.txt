This project is a C++ injector framework that uses a mapped kernel driver to support game process injection.
It includes payload dropper logic, privilege elevation helpers, randomized staging paths, and mapper execution flow.
The repository explicitly mentions multiple game targets and warns that using this approach can lead to bans.
It serves as an educational sample for studying driver-backed injection techniques in game security research.
