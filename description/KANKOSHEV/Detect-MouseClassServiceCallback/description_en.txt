This project is a kernel-mode proof of concept focused on MouseClassServiceCallback hook detection.
It includes low-level hook handling code and driver logic to observe or validate mouse callback execution paths.
The repository is structured as a Windows kernel project built with Visual Studio and WDK-style components.
It is mainly relevant to anti-cheat and rootkit detection research around input interception.
