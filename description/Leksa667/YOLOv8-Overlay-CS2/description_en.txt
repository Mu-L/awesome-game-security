This project is a Python-based real-time CS2 overlay that detects enemy players with a YOLOv8 ONNX model.
It uses ONNX Runtime for inference, mss for screen capture, and Pygame plus Win32 APIs to render a transparent topmost overlay window.
The implementation includes optional CUDA acceleration, confidence filtering, hotkeys, and a smooth aim-assist routine.
Its primary use case is computer-vision cheat prototyping and related anti-cheat research on AI-assisted detection behavior.
