This project is a cross-platform UI automation framework for games and mobile apps. It is primarily written in Python and uses image recognition to locate UI elements without injecting into the target process. The framework provides device control APIs, scalable execution on device farms, command-line and Python interfaces, HTML reporting, and integration with an IDE and object-hierarchy tooling for advanced UI interaction. It is mainly used by QA engineers and game or app teams that need repeatable end-to-end automation across Android, iOS, and desktop environments.
