This project is a Windows DLL injector focused on manual mapping instead of standard LoadLibrary injection.
It includes both injector and loader components in C/C++, with support for thread hijacking and NtCreateThreadEx-based launch paths.
The implementation covers import resolution, relocation handling, TLS callback execution, and optional exception support for mapped modules.
It also exposes stealth-oriented flags such as header wiping or faking, PEB unlinking, DLL name scrambling, and handle-hijack based process access.
It is intended for advanced game security and malware-analysis researchers studying injection tradecraft and anti-detection behavior.
