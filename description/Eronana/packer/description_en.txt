This project is a basic Win32 executable packer for 32-bit PE files.
It is written in C++ and integrates a companion compression component to reduce payload size before rebuilding the packed executable.
The repository includes Visual Studio solution files, command-line usage guidance, and an extension branch that demonstrates self-validation ideas.
Its main use case is learning PE packing concepts for reverse engineering, binary protection experiments, and unpacking research.
