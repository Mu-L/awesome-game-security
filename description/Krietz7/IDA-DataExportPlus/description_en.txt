This project is an IDA Pro plugin that extends and replaces the default data export window.
It supports exporting selected data in multiple integer and floating-point formats and can also export assembly text.
The plugin is implemented in Python and targets modern IDA Pro versions through a hotkey-driven interface.
Its workflow is designed to speed up repetitive extraction tasks during reverse engineering.
It is mainly useful for binary analysts and security researchers who need structured export from disassembly views.
