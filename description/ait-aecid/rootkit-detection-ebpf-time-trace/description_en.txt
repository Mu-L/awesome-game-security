rootkit-detection-ebpf-time-trace is a Linux research framework for detecting rootkits by analyzing timing anomalies in kernel execution paths. It uses eBPF probes to collect fine-grained timing data from functions in the getdents flow, including paths manipulated by file-hiding rootkits. The repository includes Python tooling for experiment orchestration, dataset handling, and semi-supervised statistical anomaly detection with evaluation outputs. Its primary audience is kernel security researchers studying behavior-based rootkit detection and anti-stealth telemetry techniques.
