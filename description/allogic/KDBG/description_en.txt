KDBG is a Windows kernel debugging toolkit that combines a kernel driver backend with a command-line client. It offers low-level memory read/write operations for both user processes and kernel modules, plus module/thread enumeration and trace-oriented features, with additional debugger functions in progress. The code is focused on x64 workflows and requires driver-loading steps that may temporarily alter driver-signing behavior. It is aimed at advanced researchers doing low-level game debugging, anti-cheat analysis, and kernel security experimentation.
