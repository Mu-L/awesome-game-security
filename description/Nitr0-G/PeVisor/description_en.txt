This project is an early-stage Windows PE analysis and instrumentation toolkit centered on a component named PeVisor.
It is implemented in C and C++ and integrates low-level dependencies such as Blackbone and Unicorn for process control, hooking, mapping, and emulation-oriented workflows.
The repository includes sample targets and protection versus unprotection test material, indicating use in reverse engineering and binary experimentation.
It is primarily suited to advanced malware and game security researchers exploring PE internals, runtime hooks, and emulator-assisted analysis.
