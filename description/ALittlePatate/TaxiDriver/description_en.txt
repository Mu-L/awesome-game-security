This project is a Linux kernel and user-mode pair for reading and writing memory in other processes. It is implemented in C and C++ with kernel-module build scripts, and exposes operations like base-address lookup, RPM, and WPM through a device interface. The repository also includes user-mode examples and test programs to demonstrate communication with the driver. It is intended for low-level game memory tooling and Linux security research.
