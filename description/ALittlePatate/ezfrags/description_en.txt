This project is a reverse-engineering reconstruction of a well-known legacy FPS cheat. It is mainly written in C++ and documents a decompilation workflow based on IDA databases and incremental reimplementation of original modules. The code and notes track progress on features such as glow ESP, radar, no-flash, bunny hop, and related memory/signature utilities. It is aimed at learners studying cheat internals, malware-style obfuscation patterns, and practical reversing.
