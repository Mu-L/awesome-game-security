This project is the official C# reference source for the Unity engine and editor. It exposes a large portion of Unity's managed-side implementation so developers can inspect API behavior and internal editor workflows. The repository is primarily C# and mirrors Unity's internal source tree layout, but it is distributed under a reference-only license. It is mainly used for engine understanding, debugging, tooling research, and deep technical study of Unity internals.
