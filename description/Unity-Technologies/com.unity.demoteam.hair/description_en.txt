This project is an integrated Unity package for authoring, importing, simulating, and rendering strand-based hair. It supports Alembic groom import, procedural generation, GPU-driven simulation constraints, hierarchical LOD, and rendering across built-in, URP, and HDRP pipelines. The implementation combines C# editor/runtime systems with shader code for real-time performance. It is intended for advanced character rendering workflows, digital human production, and real-time graphics research.
