This project is a leaked and modified external Fortnite cheat codebase that includes both user-mode and kernel-mode components. The user-mode side is built in C++ with a DirectX9 Dear ImGui overlay, while the kernel side contains driver logic and callback-based communication code. The accompanying notes discuss detection status, loader behavior, and mapping techniques used to deploy the driver. It is mainly relevant to cheat reverse engineering, anti-cheat bypass analysis, and studying real-world pasted cheat infrastructure.
