This project is a scripting and modding framework for Unreal Engine 4 and 5 games. It combines a Lua scripting API, a C++ modding API, blueprint mod loading, live property inspection and editing, and multiple data dumpers. The codebase is centered on modern C++ with supporting tooling for runtime hooks and SDK/header generation. It is designed for advanced mod development, runtime analysis, and Unreal game reverse engineering research.
