This project is a minimal Unreal Engine 4 silent-aim technique example based on viewpoint function hooks.
It is written in C++ and demonstrates hooking player camera and view APIs to alter aim direction while preserving visible view behavior.
The code focuses on manipulating rotation and target bone selection logic during input-triggered execution.
Its primary use case is game security research and understanding aim-manipulation vectors in UE4 titles.
