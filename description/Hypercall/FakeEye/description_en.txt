This project is a lightweight emulator for a BattlEye-style game launcher environment.
It is a compact C++ codebase built around Visual Studio project files and helper headers.
The implementation focuses on reproducing launcher-side behavior for controlled experiments.
Its primary use case is anti-cheat research and compatibility testing in isolated lab setups.
