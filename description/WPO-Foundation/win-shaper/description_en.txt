This project is a Windows traffic-shaping packet filter for emulating real-world network conditions.
It combines a kernel driver built on Windows Filtering Platform callouts with command-line and GUI control applications.
The tool can inject latency, limit bandwidth, apply packet loss, and manage queue sizes for inbound and outbound traffic.
It is intended for testing network-sensitive software and games under controlled adverse conditions.
