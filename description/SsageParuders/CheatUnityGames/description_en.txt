This project is an Android native development template aimed at Unity game cheat experimentation.
It is built around C and C++ NDK workflows in VSCode and includes scripts for building shared objects and native binaries.
The codebase integrates common mobile game hacking components such as Il2CppResolver and Dobby for runtime analysis and hooking.
Its main use case is studying Android injection and native-layer manipulation techniques for Unity targets.
