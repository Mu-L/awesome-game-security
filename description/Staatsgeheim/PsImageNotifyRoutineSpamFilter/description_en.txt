This project is a Windows kernel utility that filters noisy PsImageNotifyRoutine callback events.
It uses stack walking with RtlWalkFrameChain to distinguish meaningful image-load notifications from common background noise sources.
The implementation is in C for 64-bit Windows driver development and demonstrates practical callback hygiene.
It is useful for kernel monitoring, anti-cheat telemetry collection, and cleaner driver-side event analysis.
