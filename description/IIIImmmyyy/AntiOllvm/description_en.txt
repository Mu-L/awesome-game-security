AntiOllvm is an Arm64 simulated execution framework for removing OLLVM control-flow flattening. It identifies dispatcher patterns and reconstructs complete if-else control-flow graphs from obfuscated functions. The core tool is written in C#, with companion Python scripts for IDA CFG extraction, machine-code generation via Keystone, and CFG rebuilding. It is primarily for reverse engineers analyzing obfuscated binaries in security and game-protection research.
