This project adds Lua scripting support to C# environments such as Unity, .NET, and Mono.
It provides two-way interop between Lua and C#, runtime hotfix capabilities, and performance-focused options like generated binding code and GC optimizations.
The repository includes C#, Lua, and native runtime components for multiple platforms used by game clients.
It is mainly used by game teams that want flexible scripting and live logic updates without frequent full builds.
