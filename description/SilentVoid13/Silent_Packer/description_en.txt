This project is a pure C binary packer for ELF and PE executables. It supports multiple packing methods such as section insertion, code cave techniques, and text-section infection, with XOR and AES-based encryption options. The codebase includes low-level loader and assembly components for unpacking behavior at runtime. It is mainly used for reverse engineering practice, obfuscation experiments, and defensive research on packed binaries.
