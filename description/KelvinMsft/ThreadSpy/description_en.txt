This project is a hardware-assisted thread hijacking framework for Windows. It focuses on taking over running threads on the fly without patching instruction bytes, enabling code injection or memory operations inside target process contexts. The code is primarily C++ with kernel-oriented components and build setup for Visual Studio and WDK toolchains. It is designed for advanced security research into stealth execution redirection and anti-cheat bypass techniques.
