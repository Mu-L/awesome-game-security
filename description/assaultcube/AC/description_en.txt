This project is an open-source multiplayer first-person shooter built on the CUBE engine. The codebase is primarily C and C++ and ships with extensive game assets, maps, scripts, and cross-platform launch tooling for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It emphasizes lightweight performance, low-latency network play, built-in map editing, bot support, demos, and multiple competitive game modes. The repository is mainly useful to game developers and security researchers who need a full FPS codebase for engine study, modding, or gameplay and anti-cheat experimentation.
