This project is a universal anti-cheat research kit designed to integrate with games and detect cheating behavior. It is mostly built in C++ with multiple modules, integration examples, documentation, and companion red-team tooling for adversarial testing. The framework includes client-side monitoring components and supporting infrastructure intended for experimentation rather than production deployment. Its primary audience is game security researchers developing and validating anti-cheat concepts.
