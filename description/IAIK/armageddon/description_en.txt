This project provides libraries and tools for cache side-channel attacks on ARM-based mobile devices.
It is primarily written in C with supporting Python utilities and Make-based build infrastructure.
The toolkit covers Prime+Probe, Flush+Reload, Evict+Reload, Flush+Flush, and cache template attack workflows.
It targets academic and applied security research on mobile privacy leakage, cryptographic side channels, and TrustZone observation.
