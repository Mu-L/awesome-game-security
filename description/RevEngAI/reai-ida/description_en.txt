This project is an IDA Pro plugin that connects the disassembler to an AI-assisted reverse engineering platform.
It supports binary upload, similarity-based function matching, automated renaming, auto-unstrip workflows, and AI decompilation views.
The plugin is implemented in Python with Qt-based dialogs and service layers for API integration.
It is designed for reverse engineers who want to accelerate analysis of stripped binaries with machine-learning-assisted tooling.
