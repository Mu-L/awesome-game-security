This project is a curated awesome-style index of game technology analysis resources. The repository is mostly Markdown and organizes links by game title, engine, developer, year, and technical topic. It is maintained as a community-driven collection with contribution guidance for consistent updates. It is useful for game programmers, rendering engineers, and reverse engineers who want references on engine internals and production techniques.
