This project is a UE4 plugin that copies supplied string arguments to the system clipboard.
It is implemented as a C++ Unreal Engine module with packaged binaries and plugin metadata for UE4.27 environments.
The tool is lightweight and focused on exposing quick clipboard output from in-engine workflows.
It is useful for game development tooling and debugging pipelines that need fast text transfer during testing or scripting tasks.
