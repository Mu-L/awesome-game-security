CSGO-Cheats is a tutorial-oriented collection of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheat examples implemented in C++. It shows core external hacking workflows such as locating the game window, opening the process, and reading or writing memory through helper wrappers. The project is designed for Visual Studio builds and relies on current offsets to keep examples functional as the game updates. It is mainly used by beginners to learn game memory manipulation concepts and by defenders to understand common cheat patterns.
