This project is an Unreal Engine character movement plugin that recreates classic Source and HL2-style FPS movement behavior. It is written in C++ and provides systems such as bunnyhopping, surfing, strafe boosting, wall strafing, and advanced crouch movement. The repository includes source and prebuilt binaries, with setup instructions for integrating into Unreal projects. It is aimed at game developers who want fast, skill-based movement mechanics in modern FPS projects.
