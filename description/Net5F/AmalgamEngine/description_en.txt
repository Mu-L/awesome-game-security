This project is a C++ engine for building isometric, sprite-based online virtual worlds.
It provides client and server foundations, networking, chat, account systems, and live in-world editing tools.
The codebase uses CMake and focuses on scalable multiplayer behavior while remaining deployable on relatively modest hardware.
It targets game developers who want a ready technical base for persistent social worlds instead of starting from scratch.
