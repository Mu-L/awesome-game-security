This project demonstrates compile-time static string obfuscation using Zig.
It generates randomized keys during build time and applies XOR-based transform logic so plaintext strings are not stored directly in binaries.
The build pipeline targets stripped x86_64 Windows executables and emphasizes lightweight runtime decryption.
It is useful for reverse-engineering resistance experiments and anti-analysis hardening in security-oriented software.
