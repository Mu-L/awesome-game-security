This project is a curated collection of game hacking and cracking learning resources. It is written as a Markdown link list that points to tutorials, forums, reverse-engineering references, and practical tools such as dumpers and mappers. The list also includes starter bases and recommendations for titles like CS:GO, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption 2. Its primary use case is helping beginners and intermediate game security researchers quickly find study material and common tooling.
