VirtualKD-Redux is a modernized virtual machine kernel debugging acceleration toolkit for Windows and related platforms.
It supports current VMware and VirtualBox versions, works across operating systems from legacy Windows releases to Windows 11, and includes compatibility with recent WinDbg tooling.
The codebase is primarily C and C++ with driver and host-side components, plus an updated build workflow centered on modern Visual Studio toolchains.
Its main use case is low-level kernel debugging and systems security research in virtualized environments where faster debug iteration is valuable.
