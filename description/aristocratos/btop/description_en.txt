This project is an interactive terminal resource monitor for CPU, memory, disks, network, processes, and optional GPU metrics. It is written in modern C++ and provides a fast TUI with mouse support, process filtering, configurable views, and theme customization. The codebase is cross-platform across Linux, macOS, and BSD variants with flexible build and packaging options. It is intended for developers, operators, and security engineers who need real-time host telemetry in terminal environments.
