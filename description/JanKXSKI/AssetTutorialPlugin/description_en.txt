This project is an Unreal Engine tutorial plugin that demonstrates how to create a custom asset type and a dedicated editor in C++. It includes runtime and editor modules, sample UObject classes, and custom editor tooling for working with a NormalDistribution asset. The code follows Unreal plugin conventions with module build scripts and reflection-enabled classes. It is mainly aimed at Unreal developers who want a hands-on reference for extending the engine's asset pipeline and editor workflow.
