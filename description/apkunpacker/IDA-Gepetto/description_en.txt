This project is an IDA Pro plugin that uses local LLMs to explain decompiled functions and suggest better variable names. Built in Python for IDAPython, it integrates into the pseudocode UI with context-menu actions and keyboard shortcuts. It supports configurable model backends and localization through plugin settings and translation files. It is aimed at reverse engineers who want to accelerate malware analysis and game security research workflows inside IDA.
