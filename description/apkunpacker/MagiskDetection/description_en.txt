This project is an archive-style collection of Android proof-of-concept apps used to detect root, Magisk, and related tampering environments. It aggregates many APK samples and documents checks such as Zygisk detection, hook and instrumentation detection, bootloader or ROM checks, and root app discovery. The repository also provides hashes and references to help analysts compare sample behavior across tools. It is primarily intended for mobile security analysts and anti-cheat researchers studying real-world root-detection techniques.
