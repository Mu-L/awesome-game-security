This project is a native 2D game engine implemented in C++ with OpenGL rendering. It provides a relatively high-level cross-platform API with geometry primitives such as vectors, rectangles, and circles, and it outlines roadmap items like shaders, physics, and mobile support. The repository includes engine source files and Visual Studio-oriented build artifacts for Windows development workflows. Its main use case is learning engine architecture and serving as a base for custom 2D game development experiments.
