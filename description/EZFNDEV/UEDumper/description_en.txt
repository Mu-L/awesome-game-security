This project is an Unreal Engine dumper that generates SDK-style output from running games. It is primarily written in C++ and targets object name extraction, offset discovery, and header generation for UE-based titles. The README describes an injection-based workflow and automated offset finding, while also noting version limitations and some hardcoded or unstable parts. It is mainly intended for Unreal reverse engineering and game security research.
