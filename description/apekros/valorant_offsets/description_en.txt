This project is a small offset dump repository that publishes updated memory offsets for a popular shooter game.
It stores constants in a C++ header and keeps the data simple for direct integration into external tooling.
The repository is minimal and focused on maintaining address and structure offsets rather than providing a full framework.
It is typically used by game reverse-engineering practitioners who track client updates for analysis or tooling maintenance.
