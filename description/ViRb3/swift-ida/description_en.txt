This project is an IDA Pro plugin that improves analysis of binaries using nonstandard calling conventions and multi-value returns. It is written in Python and adds context menu actions to retag functions for conventions like Swift, Golang, and fastcall. The plugin can also generate tuple-like return structures to make decompiled output easier to interpret. Its main use case is reverse engineering modern language runtimes and compiler ABIs.
