This project provides scripting support resources and examples for extending debugger workflows in x64dbg. It includes script samples plus helper Python code for exporting function labels and comments from IDA into debugger sessions. The examples demonstrate practical automation patterns such as multi-step execution control, global variable usage, and instruction-sequence searching. It is primarily useful for reverse engineers who want to speed up repetitive analysis tasks in game and binary security research.
