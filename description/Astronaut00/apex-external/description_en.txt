ApexCheat is an external cheat and SDK project for Apex Legends. It is primarily written in C++ and includes an ImGui-based menu and overlay pipeline with modules for glow visuals, aimbot logic, and memory-driven entity handling. The repository also includes a Rust-based offset dumper component to help maintain game structure offsets. It is intended for cheat prototyping and reverse engineering experiments, and the included notes describe the implementation as outdated.
