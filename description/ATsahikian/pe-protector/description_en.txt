This project is a Windows PE protection framework designed to make executables harder to crack and analyze. It is implemented mainly in C++ and provides instruction mutation, a built-in x86 assembler pipeline, configurable stub logic, and binary compression support. The repository also includes compiler components, tests, and CMake-based build tooling for reproducible development. Its primary use case is software protection research, anti-tamper experimentation, and understanding packer-style defense techniques.
