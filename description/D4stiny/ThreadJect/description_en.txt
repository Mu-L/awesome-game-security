This project is a proof-of-concept manual DLL injector that hijacks an existing thread in a target process. It validates and maps the DLL payload, prepares loader metadata, patches shellcode with runtime addresses, and redirects thread execution to complete injection. The implementation is C++ on Windows with Visual Studio project support and emphasizes low-level control over the injection chain. It is intended for process injection research and for building detection test cases in endpoint security studies.
