This project is a kernel-mode threat detection platform for Windows that focuses on behavior-based malware detection. It monitors events like process creation, image loading, remote thread activity, hidden code execution, and suspicious filesystem or registry operations with stack-trace context. The codebase includes a driver, command-line components, and a Qt-based GUI for telemetry and response workflows. It is aimed at defensive security experiments and anti-malware research, especially in high-visibility test environments.
