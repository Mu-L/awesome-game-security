PureDOOM is a header only, dependency free DOOM source port implemented in pure C. It packages the engine logic into a single portable interface that avoids standard library dependencies and supports both 32 bit and 64 bit targets. The project includes practical gameplay options and a minimal integration model for embedding DOOM into unusual or constrained environments. It is primarily useful for engine experimentation, low level runtime research, and developers who want a compact retro game core.
