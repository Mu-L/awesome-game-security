This project is an Unreal Engine plugin that provides an event-flow graph system for gameplay and narrative scripting. It is implemented mostly in C++ with editor integration and focuses on async node execution, custom pin layouts, and visual debugging support. The architecture is intentionally design-agnostic so teams can build reusable game-specific nodes and extend editor behavior without rewriting core graph logic. Its primary use case is structured storytelling and gameplay flow authoring in Unreal projects.
