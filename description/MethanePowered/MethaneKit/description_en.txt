MethaneKit is a cross-platform graphics and application framework that abstracts modern 3D rendering APIs behind a unified interface.
The codebase is mostly C++ with CMake, and supports DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal while sharing shader workflows across platforms.
It includes tutorials, sample apps, testing infrastructure, and modular runtime components for building high-performance rendering applications.
The project is useful for engine and tooling developers who need a portable graphics foundation for visualization, game, or security-adjacent rendering experiments.
