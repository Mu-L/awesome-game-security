This project is a dynamic binary instrumentation toolkit for Android ARM and Thumb targets.
It combines a hijack injector with a base hooking library to load instrumentation code into running processes and hook function entry points inline.
The code and build flow rely on C and C++ with Android NDK tooling, plus sample instruments that demonstrate runtime logging and behavior interception.
It is intended for mobile reverse engineering, runtime analysis, and security research on Android applications.
