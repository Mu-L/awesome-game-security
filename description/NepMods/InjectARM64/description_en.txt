This project is a non-root cheat injection platform for ARM devices on Android.
It combines Java and Kotlin Android components with C and C++ native modules and hooking code to inject payloads in a virtualized app space.
The framework advertises ARM32 and ARM64 support, configurable injection flows, and compatibility with newer Android releases.
It is aimed at game hacking researchers who want to prototype mobile injection techniques without root access.
