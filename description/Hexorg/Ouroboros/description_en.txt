This project is a symbolic-execution decompiler built in Rust for recovering high-level program structure from binaries.
Its design emphasizes constraint tracking, expression rewriting, and structured control-flow reconstruction beyond classic SSA-only approaches.
The codebase includes processor specification assets and a modern frontend stack for interactive analysis.
It is aimed at reverse engineering researchers and developers exploring advanced decompilation techniques.
