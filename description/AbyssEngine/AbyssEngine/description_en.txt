This project is a clean-room reimplementation of a classic action RPG engine written in C. It provides cross-platform engine components such as rendering, audio, scene management, MPQ asset handling, and media decoding using libraries like SDL2, FFmpeg, zlib, and libarchive. The codebase focuses on portability and extensibility rather than reusing original proprietary game code. Its main audience is engine developers and modding-oriented researchers who want a transparent foundation for studying and extending legacy game behavior.
