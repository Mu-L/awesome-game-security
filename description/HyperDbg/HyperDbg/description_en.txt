This project is an open-source hypervisor-assisted debugger for Windows user-mode and kernel-mode analysis.
It is implemented mainly in C and C++ and relies on hardware virtualization features such as Intel VT-x and EPT.
Key capabilities include stealth breakpoints, hidden hooks, memory-access monitoring, and extensible debugging workflows.
It is designed for reverse engineering, fuzzing, malware analysis, and anti-cheat or anti-debug research.
