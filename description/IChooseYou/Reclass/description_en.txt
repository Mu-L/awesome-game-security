Reclass is a structured binary editor for reverse engineering unknown data layouts. It lets you interpret raw bytes as typed fields such as structs, arrays, pointers, and primitives, with inline editing, foldable views, and hex/ASCII previews. The project is built mainly in C++17 with Qt 6 and QScintilla, and also supports plugins for process memory and WinDbg data sources. It is aimed at reverse engineers and game security researchers who need to inspect live process memory, dump files, or other binary sources.
