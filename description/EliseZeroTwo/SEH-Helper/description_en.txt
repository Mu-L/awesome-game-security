This project is a Binary Ninja plugin that helps analysts inspect Structured Exception Handler chains in PE binaries. It is written in Python and provides UI actions to list entries, inspect the handler at the cursor, or continuously follow cursor context. The tool is focused on improving visibility into exception metadata during static analysis sessions. It is mainly intended for reverse engineers working on Windows binaries, including malware and game security investigations.
