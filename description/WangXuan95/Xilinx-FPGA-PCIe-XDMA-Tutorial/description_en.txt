This project is a hands-on tutorial for building PCIe communication systems on Xilinx FPGAs using the XDMA IP core.
It provides step-by-step examples for BRAM read and write designs, AXI integration, Linux-side C software, and a larger MPEG2 acceleration workflow.
The material mixes Vivado projects, Verilog and AXI logic, and host tooling guidance, including driver loading and test procedures.
It is aimed at FPGA and hardware security practitioners, including DMA-oriented game security research scenarios.
