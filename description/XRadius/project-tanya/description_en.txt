This project is a service-oriented external game automation framework focused on Apex Legends memory interaction.
It is built in C# on .NET with modular components for core memory access, driver abstraction, game-state modeling, and separate Aim and Sense feature layers.
The repository includes Linux service build and install scripts as well as hardening guidance such as process isolation and ptrace restrictions.
It targets advanced game hacking research workflows that require long-running, stealth-conscious, memory-driven tooling.
