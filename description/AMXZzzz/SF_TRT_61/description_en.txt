This project is a Windows computer-vision aiming framework that links object detection with automated mouse control. It is primarily written in C++ and integrates DXGI capture, OpenCV preprocessing, ImGui configuration panels, and both TensorRT and DirectML/ONNX inference backends. The pipeline supports YOLO-style models, post-processing, PID/FOV movement tuning, trigger logic, and multiple input injection methods. It is designed for practical experimentation in AI-assisted game automation and anti-cheat evasion research.
