This project is a .NET protection toolkit that bundles anti-debugging, anti-virtualization, anti-injection, and hook-detection techniques for managed applications. It is written in C# and includes checks ranging from PEB and thread flags to sandbox heuristics, syscall-based probes, and integrity hardening features. The repository also covers detection of common anti-anti-debug user-mode hooks and several runtime tamper scenarios. Its primary use case is hardening software and building defensive components for anti-cheat or anti-cracking workflows.
