This project is a Windows Unreal Engine dumper and SDK generator for specific UE4 versions. It is implemented in C++ and uses process memory access, pattern scanning, and engine structure parsing to locate name and object data at runtime. It outputs names, objects, and generated SDK headers for inspected game builds, with configuration-driven version handling. It is intended for Unreal game reverse engineering and tooling development in game security research.
