This repository demonstrates Windows instrumentation callbacks for process-level syscall and exception interception. The codebase uses C++ and assembly and includes a TLS-based design to reduce callback recursion issues when making additional syscalls. It shows how to monitor syscall origins and discusses both analysis and abuse-oriented scenarios. The main audience is reverse engineers and anti-cheat researchers exploring undocumented Windows internals for telemetry and runtime control.
