This project is a Windows kernel driver for investigating traces left by vulnerable drivers. It scans paging structures to locate known driver artifacts and supports 1 GB, 2 MB, and 4 KB page mappings. The implementation is written in C/C++ with WDK-style driver tooling and is aimed at low-level memory forensics. It is primarily intended for anti-cheat and kernel security research focused on detecting or understanding prior unsigned driver activity.
