This project provides FPGA firmware for PCILeech-style DMA hardware used to emulate PCIe devices in security testing.
It is built mainly with Verilog and SystemVerilog, plus Xilinx Vivado IP cores and board-specific build scripts.
The codebase includes logic for PCIe configuration-space behavior, interrupt handling patterns, and multiple hardware persona profiles.
It is primarily used for low-level anti-cheat evasion research and experimentation with DMA-based detection bypass techniques.
