This project is an IDA Pro plugin that automates vulnerability discovery on decompiled pseudocode. It is built in Python and runs rule-based SAST scans through opengrep/semgrep-style YAML patterns, then presents findings inside an interactive IDA interface. The plugin also supports optional AI-assisted explanations to help triage and understand discovered issues. It is designed for reverse engineers, CTF players, and security auditors who want faster binary vulnerability analysis workflows.
