This project is a Windows PE import obfuscation tool that makes static API sequence analysis more difficult.
It is written in C++ and rewrites Import Address Table entries by swapping imported functions within the same DLL.
A companion TLS-based header is used to restore correct import behavior at runtime before the program's main logic executes.
The main use case is educational security research into import-hiding techniques and their impact on malware analysis workflows.
