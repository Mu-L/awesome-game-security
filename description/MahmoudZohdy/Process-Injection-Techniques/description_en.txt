This project is a C/C++ collection of Windows process injection and persistence technique implementations.
It includes multiple approaches such as CreateRemoteThread variants, APC and Early Bird methods, TLS callback injection, thread hijacking, reflective DLL loading, process hollowing, doppelganging, and ghosting.
The codebase also covers persistence-oriented mechanisms like IFEO, AppInit_DLLs, and AppCertDlls, with usage guidance from a single command-line entry point.
It is mainly used for security training, offensive technique research, and testing defensive detections in controlled lab environments.
