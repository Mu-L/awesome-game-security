NullHooks is a learning-focused CS:GO cheat project implemented in C++. It includes a modular codebase with gameplay features, configuration presets, and supporting utilities commonly used in internal cheat development. The repository documents references and contribution notes, and it is marked as inactive while still useful for study. Its primary use case is educational exploration of game-hacking architecture and implementation techniques.
