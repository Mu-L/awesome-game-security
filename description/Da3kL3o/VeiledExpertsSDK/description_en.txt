VeiledExpertsSDK is a generated software development kit dump for the game Veiled Experts. It mainly contains a large Unreal Engine style C++ header set along with object and name tables that describe in game classes, structs, and runtime metadata. The codebase is useful for understanding internal game data layouts and API surfaces when building external tools or performing static analysis. It is primarily intended for reverse engineers and game security researchers who need a reference map of the target game's internals.
