Artemis is a C++ game modification framework targeting Rainbow Six: Siege Shadow Legacy. It includes injection and hooking infrastructure with components such as ImGui and MinHook, plus managers for events, keybinds, drawing, and game interactions. The architecture is designed to support user-made extensions through a modular framework approach. This project is primarily aimed at cheat development and reverse engineering experimentation.
