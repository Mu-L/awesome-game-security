Finger is a function symbol recognition system for binary analysis that helps identify unknown library or routine names. It provides both a Python SDK and an IDA plugin that extract function features, submit them to a recognition backend, and rename or highlight matched functions in IDA. The project targets IDA 7+ and supports Python 2.7 and Python 3 environments. It is intended for reverse engineers who want to accelerate binary triage and function recovery in malware or game-related samples.
