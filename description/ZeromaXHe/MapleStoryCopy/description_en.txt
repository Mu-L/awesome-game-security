This project is a Godot-based recreation effort for MapleStory-style client gameplay. The client is written in C# using Godot .NET and is accompanied by a large amount of scene, sprite, and audio assets for character and map presentation. Its structure focuses on client-side content organization and learning-oriented implementation rather than production deployment. It is mainly useful for developers studying 2D MMORPG client architecture and content workflows.
