This project is an internal Fortnite cheat base built around injected C++ code and Unreal Engine object access. It includes a configurable in-game menu with memory aim, silent aim, FOV controls, and multiple ESP modules such as box, skeleton, line, name, weapon, and ammo displays. The implementation also contains offset-finding helpers, call-spoofing routines, and weapon behavior hooks like rapid fire and instant reload. It is primarily aimed at offensive cheat prototyping and anti-cheat researchers studying internal cheat architecture.
