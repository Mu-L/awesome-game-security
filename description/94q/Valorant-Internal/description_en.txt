This project is a C++ internal cheat implementation for a tactical FPS game. It includes aiming features such as basic, memory-based, and silent aim variants, plus ESP visuals like boxes, chams, and glow. Additional modules cover FOV changes and movement-style exploits such as fly and third-person modes, with menu control via configurable hotkeys. It is mainly intended for game hacking experimentation and reverse-engineering practice.
