This project is a long-running C++ game engine focused on modern GPU-driven rendering. It features a bindless renderer with real-time global illumination, hardware ray tracing, and a high-frequency physics simulation pipeline. The codebase includes substantial engine subsystems, assets, build scripts, and third-party integrations for real-time 3D development workflows. It is aimed at engine programmers, graphics researchers, and advanced game development experimentation.
