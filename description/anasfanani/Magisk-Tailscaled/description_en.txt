Magisk Tailscaled is a Magisk module that runs the Tailscale daemon on rooted Android devices. It configures userspace networking so Tailscale can coexist with Android VPN usage, and includes service scripts plus tunnel helpers for routing traffic. The module provides practical CLI-driven workflows for login, remote SSH, and ADB-over-tailnet scenarios on arm and arm64 devices. It is intended for advanced Android users and mobile security researchers who need persistent remote connectivity on rooted phones.
