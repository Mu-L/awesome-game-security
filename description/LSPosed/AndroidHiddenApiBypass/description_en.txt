Android Hidden Api Bypass is a Java library for bypassing Android non-SDK interface restrictions so hidden framework APIs can be accessed at runtime.
It provides two variants, HiddenApiBypass and LSPass, with APIs for invoking restricted methods and constructors, reading hidden fields, and managing exemption prefixes.
The implementation avoids native code and is packaged for modern Android dependency workflows.
It is commonly used in advanced Android instrumentation, compatibility tooling, and security research.
