This project is a real-time AI aiming assistant core that combines screen capture, object detection, and automated mouse control. It is written in C++ and uses DXGI Desktop Duplication for low-latency capture, ONNX Runtime with TensorRT for YOLO inference, and OpenCV for vision processing. The input layer is built around a driver-level mouse simulation interface to convert detections into relative cursor movement. Its primary use case is technical research into real-time computer vision driven game automation.
