Onlooker is a lightweight Windows memory profiler that records memory statistics for a process tree, similar to the Linux time command. It includes a companion Qt-based GUI tool for inspecting traces and logs in a more visual workflow. The project is implemented mainly in C++ with CMake and Qt Widgets, and it also provides JSON trace conversion utilities. Its primary use case is diagnosing memory growth, out-of-memory events, and performance regressions in complex native toolchains.
