This project is a C++ internal cheat base for Rainbow Six Siege focused on rendering and gameplay feature prototypes.
It ships with a small SDK, hooking utilities, and an ImGui plus DirectX 11 overlay pipeline for in-process visuals.
Included examples cover snapline ESP, basic targeting logic, keyboard handling, and entity access patterns.
The main use case is educational experimentation with internal game hacking architecture rather than production-ready bypassing.
