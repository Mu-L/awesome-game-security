This project is an external ESP implementation for Counter-Strike 2. It is written in C++ and uses process memory reads, configurable JSON offsets, and world-to-screen math to track in-game entities. Rendering is handled through a transparent Win32/GDI overlay that draws boxes, health bars, and player names. Its primary use case is cheat prototyping and practical game memory analysis.
