This project is an AI-assisted WinDbg extension that can answer debugging questions and run debugger commands automatically. It supports multiple model providers, persistent conversation context, command execution with explanations, and decompilation-oriented assistance. The C++ codebase also exposes HTTP and MCP style interfaces with a companion CLI for external tool integration. It is designed for crash triage, exploit debugging, and advanced Windows security analysis workflows.
