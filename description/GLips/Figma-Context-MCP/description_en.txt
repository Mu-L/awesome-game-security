Framelink MCP for Figma is a Model Context Protocol server that gives AI coding agents structured access to Figma design data. It is built in TypeScript and provides dedicated tools to fetch simplified design metadata and download referenced images. The server supports multiple transports such as stdio and HTTP while translating raw Figma API responses into model-friendly layout and style context. Its primary use case is design-to-code automation for developers who want assistants to implement UI accurately from Figma files.
