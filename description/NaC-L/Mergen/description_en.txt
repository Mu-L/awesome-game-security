This project is a binary lifting framework that converts assembly behavior into LLVM IR for deeper analysis.
It focuses on symbolic execution, control-flow recovery, deobfuscation, and devirtualization of protected binaries.
The implementation is primarily C and C++ with LLVM-oriented workflows and disassembly support components.
It is designed for reverse engineers and software security researchers, including analysts studying protected game binaries.
