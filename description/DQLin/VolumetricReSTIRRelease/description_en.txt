This project is a research implementation of spatiotemporal reservoir resampling for fast volumetric rendering. It integrates a custom volumetric render pass into a Falcor-based C++ and Slang renderer, and includes scripts and scene pipelines to reproduce paper results. The code emphasizes real-time quality and performance on modern RTX-class hardware. It is mainly intended for graphics researchers and engine developers exploring advanced rendering techniques with practical real-time applications.
