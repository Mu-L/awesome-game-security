This project is a Windows C++ HWID spoofer targeting disk serial numbers, SMART disk identifiers, and SMBIOS-related values. It provides low-level helper modules and Visual Studio project files for building and testing the concept. The author describes it as an older proof of concept with significant room for improvement and detection hardening. Its main use case is educational research into hardware fingerprint spoofing techniques discussed in anti-cheat evasion contexts.
