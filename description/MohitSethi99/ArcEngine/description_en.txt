This project is a custom C++ game engine with an accompanying editor and scripting layer. Its source tree shows subsystems for rendering, scene management, physics, audio, input, and tooling, along with platform-specific backends and shader assets. The repository also includes a C# script core, premake-based build setup, vendor dependencies, and a sandbox project for running sample content. It is mainly intended for engine architecture experimentation and practical game development prototyping.
