BattleAnalysis176 is a C++ console utility that estimates in-game farming performance for MapleStory v176 sessions. It reads client values through pointers and offsets, then calculates projected mesos and NX gains over hourly intervals. The tool is lightweight and centered on memory-reading logic rather than a graphical interface. It is mainly used in private server or reverse engineering contexts where users want quick runtime economy metrics.
