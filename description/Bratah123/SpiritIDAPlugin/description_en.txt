SpiritIDAPlugin is an IDA Pro plugin for analyzing MapleStory packet-related code paths. It is written in Python for IDAPython and automates extraction of packet structures, header identification, and function output generation. The plugin can export decoded findings to text files to support offline review and protocol documentation. It is primarily used by game reverse engineers who need faster packet analysis inside IDA.
