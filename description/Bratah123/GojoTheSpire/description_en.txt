GojoTheSpire is a Java mod that adds a custom Gojo Satoru character experience to Slay the Spire. The project includes new card and deck content, character assets, and supporting mod configuration files. Its implementation follows the game modding ecosystem conventions rather than binary exploitation or anti-cheat research tooling. The primary use case is gameplay customization and learning character-mod development for Slay the Spire.
