cs2-sdk is an auto-generated C++ header SDK for Counter-Strike 2 Source 2 binaries. It contains large sets of class and enum declarations for modules such as client, server, rendering, networking, and schema systems, produced with source2gen tooling. The repository also includes patch metadata files that tie the generated headers to a specific game version. Its primary use case is reverse engineering and game security research that needs up-to-date type information.
