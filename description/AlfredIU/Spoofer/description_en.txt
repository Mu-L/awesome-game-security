This project is a Windows C++ game-hacking package that combines a user-mode overlay cheat with driver-side components. The user-mode code includes modules such as aimbot, ESP visuals, entity caching, and projectile prediction, rendered through a DirectX9 ImGui interface. The repository also contains kernel driver build artifacts and spoofing-oriented branding, indicating mixed focus on cheating and identity evasion workflows. It is mainly relevant for studying offensive game cheat architecture and anti-cheat bypass tradecraft.
