This project is a Windows desktop HWID spoofer launcher with a custom GUI. It is written in C++ and uses Dear ImGui with DirectX 9 to present a simple interface and run spoofing actions. The application workflow downloads external driver and helper binaries, then executes a command-line step to apply spoofing changes. Its intended use case is game anti-cheat bypass workflows, especially for users who prefer a one-click front end.
