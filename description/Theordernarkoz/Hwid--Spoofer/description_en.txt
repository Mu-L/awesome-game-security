This project is a Windows kernel-mode HWID spoofer driver. The code is primarily in C and built with KMDF, with routines that hook disk, mount, and network control paths to alter hardware-identifying values. It contains logic for changing identifiers related to disks, NIC data, SMBIOS information, and GPU-related strings. The main use case is anti-cheat evasion and low-level hardware identity research in game security contexts.
