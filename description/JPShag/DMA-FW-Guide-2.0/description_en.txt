This project is a comprehensive firmware development guide for building custom PCIe DMA device emulation on FPGA platforms.
It documents workflow steps such as donor device profiling, PCIe configuration cloning, BAR and interrupt handling, and firmware flashing.
The repository also bundles tooling references and multi-language materials around PCILeech-style hardware stacks and Vivado-based development.
Its primary audience is hardware security and game anti-cheat researchers studying DMA attack simulation and low-level PCIe behavior.
