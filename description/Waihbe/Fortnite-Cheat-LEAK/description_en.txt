This project is a leaked Fortnite internal cheat codebase implemented in C++.
The sources include hook-driven gameplay manipulation, rendering and utility modules, and references to features such as no spread, movement and vehicle exploits, and teleport-related behavior.
It uses common Windows game-hacking components such as MinHook and Detours for function interception.
The repository is primarily relevant as a reverse-engineering sample for studying cheat architecture and detection surfaces.
