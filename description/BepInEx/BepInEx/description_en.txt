BepInEx is a plugin and modding framework for Unity Mono, Unity IL2CPP, and other .NET-based games. It is primarily written in C# and includes chainloading, preloading, logging, and configuration systems for runtime plugin management. The framework integrates patching and detour tooling to help developers extend or instrument game behavior across Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is mainly used by mod authors and game reverse engineering communities that need a stable loader for managed and native Unity targets.
