This project is a proof-of-concept PatchGuard bypass targeting recent Windows 24H2 to 25H2 builds.
It uses C and C++ kernel-mode components and is designed to be loaded with a manual mapper such as kdmapper.
The repository focuses on low-level PatchGuard research, crash-prone edge cases, and practical experimentation around CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION behavior.
It is intended for advanced Windows kernel security researchers working in controlled lab environments.
