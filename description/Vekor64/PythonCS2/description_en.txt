This project is a Python-based external Counter-Strike 2 cheat study implementation.
It uses PyMeow for memory access and rendering plus DearPyGui-based controls for runtime configuration.
Included features cover common ESP visuals such as boxes, health bars, weapon and distance labels, line rendering, and recoil control logic.
The repository is positioned as an educational reference for understanding basic external game-hacking workflows in Python.
