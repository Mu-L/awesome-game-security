This project is an external Apex Legends cheat framework written in Rust and designed to be embedded into a custom memory access backend. It includes modular features such as aim assist with PID smoothing, triggerbot logic, recoil control, ESP overlays, highlights, radar, observer tracking, and automation scripts. The codebase separates game state parsing, projectile prediction, and offset handling, with tooling to regenerate gamedata from dumped offsets. It is mainly aimed at advanced game security researchers and cheat developers studying external cheat architecture and feature engineering.
