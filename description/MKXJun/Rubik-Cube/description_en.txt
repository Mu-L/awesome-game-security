This project is a 3D Rubik's Cube game implementation built with DirectX on Windows.
It provides both a Direct3D 11 version and an older Direct3D 9 version, written in C++ with HLSL shaders and custom rendering, camera, and input systems.
The repository includes full source code, assets, and runnable release builds with keyboard and mouse controls for cube manipulation and timing.
It is mainly aimed at developers learning real-time graphics programming and game architecture with native DirectX pipelines.
