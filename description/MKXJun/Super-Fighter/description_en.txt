This project is a Windows shoot-'em-up game remake developed with DirectX technologies.
It is primarily written in C++ and combines Direct3D rendering, HLSL shader effects, and DirectSound audio playback for a complete arcade-style game loop.
The codebase includes configurable stage and enemy data files, replay support, and optional Xbox controller input alongside keyboard controls.
Its main audience is developers and students studying practical game programming patterns in native Windows graphics frameworks.
