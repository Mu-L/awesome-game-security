This project is a proof of concept for the early cascade process injection technique on Windows. It demonstrates creating a process and triggering stealthier code injection during early initialization stages, based on publicly documented research. The code is written in C++ with Visual Studio project files, and uses hardcoded structure offsets for specific OS builds. It is intended for malware analysis, EDR bypass research, and defensive testing of injection detections.
