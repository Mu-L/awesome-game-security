This project is an unofficial decompiled source mirror of Unity editor and engine assemblies. It was generated with ILSpy and exposes C# code from a Unity 5.x release for inspection. The repository contains a large C# codebase and solution files that make internal APIs and editor behavior easier to study. It is mainly useful for engine reverse engineering, tooling research, and compatibility analysis.
