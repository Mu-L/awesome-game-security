This project is a proof of concept that hooks MiniDumpWriteDump to intercept dump data before it is written to disk. It is implemented mainly in C++ with auxiliary Python scripts for receiving and decrypting transferred dump content. The workflow can optionally encrypt the captured buffer and exfiltrate it over a socket to a remote host, demonstrating how dump pipelines can be modified in memory. It is intended for security research on credential dumping tradecraft, detection engineering, and defensive validation.
