Daedalic Test Automation is an Unreal Engine 4 plugin for building and running automated integration tests. It extends the Gauntlet based testing workflow with assertions, delays, simulated input, trigger driven checks, parameterized tests, and performance oriented scenarios. The project is written mainly in C++ and is designed to improve coverage, speed up regression detection, and support unattended test execution in development pipelines. It targets game teams that want reliable QA automation and repeatable validation of gameplay behavior.
