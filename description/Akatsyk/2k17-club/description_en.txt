This project is a large C++ cheat framework targeting Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The codebase contains common offensive modules such as aimbot logic, anti-aim, autowall calculations, chams, grenade helpers, and hook-based game event handling. It also embeds DirectX9 ImGui rendering and Lua or LuaJIT scripting support through LuaBridge for configurable in-game tooling. It is mainly aimed at cheat development research and Source engine reverse engineering.
