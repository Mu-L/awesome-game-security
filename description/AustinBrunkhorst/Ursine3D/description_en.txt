Ursine 3D is a general-purpose game engine created for academic game development programs. It is built mainly in C++ and provides an entity-component system, reflection support, editor tooling, animation systems, and a full 3D rendering pipeline. The engine integrates technologies such as Bullet Physics, Wwise audio, and Chromium Embedded Framework for HTML/CSS/JS-driven interfaces. Its primary use case is game engine education, prototyping, and full project development.
