This project is a Linux internal cheat framework for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It is written primarily in C++ and includes build scripts, injection helpers, and configuration handling for deploying a feature-rich in-game module. The workflow relies on common Linux tooling such as CMake, GDB-based injection, and user-managed config directories for runtime customization. It is mainly used in game hacking research to study internal cheat architecture and client-side manipulation techniques.
