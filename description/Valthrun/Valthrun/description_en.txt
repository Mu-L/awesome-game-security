This project is an open-source external, read-only kernel-level gameplay enhancement framework for Counter-Strike 2.
It is built primarily in Rust and combines a kernel driver, overlay renderer, and radar components without injecting DLLs into the game process.
Key capabilities include configurable player ESP, bomb and spectator information, trigger features, and a stream-proof overlay.
It is mainly aimed at low-level game security and anti-detection research, especially for developers studying Windows kernel techniques.
