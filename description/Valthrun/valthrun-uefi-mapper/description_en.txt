This project is a UEFI-based mapper that loads a game driver during boot.
It is written in Rust for the x86_64 UEFI target and includes scripts to build bootable ISO images for USB deployment.
The loader can start before normal operating-system drivers, which is useful for early-stage driver initialization experiments.
Its primary use case is research into boot-time driver loading and stealth-oriented Windows security workflows.
