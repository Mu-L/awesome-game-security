SmKernel-CSGO is an educational proof of concept that demonstrates a kernel driver assisted game cheat architecture for CS:GO. It uses shared memory communication between user mode and kernel mode components to expose operations such as module base lookup and process memory read or write. The project also includes a simple triggerbot example and openly discusses detectability tradeoffs against stronger kernel anti cheat systems. It is mainly intended for learning driver based game hacking concepts and understanding anti cheat threat models.
