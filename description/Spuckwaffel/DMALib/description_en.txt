This project is a lightweight DMA helper library for game memory access workflows.
Written in C++, it wraps common operations such as process lookup, base address retrieval, memory read and write, pattern scanning, and scatter reads.
It is designed to work with DMA-related components such as LeechCore and MemProcFS through externally supplied libraries.
The primary use case is building DMA-based game security research tools with cleaner reusable code.
