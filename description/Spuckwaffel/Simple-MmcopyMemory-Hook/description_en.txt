This project is an educational Windows kernel driver that hooks MmCopyMemory.
It demonstrates a basic hook implementation to observe memory-copy behavior used by anti-cheat scanners.
The code is intentionally simple and documented for learning, and it is explicitly described as unstable and detectable in real environments.
Its main use case is understanding kernel hook mechanics and anti-cheat telemetry inspection.
