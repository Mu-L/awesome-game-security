This project is a research proof of concept focused on weaknesses in a virtual gamepad kernel driver. It documents insecure IOCTL handling and access-control issues, then provides C++ examples to trigger vulnerable paths and demonstrate potential impact such as privilege escalation or system instability. The repository includes reverse engineering artifacts and multiple PoC programs for practical validation. It is targeted at Windows kernel security research and hardening of gaming-related driver ecosystems.
