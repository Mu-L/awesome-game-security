This project is a Windows malware-style proof of concept that uses a vulnerable driver interface to terminate security processes before launching payloads. The C++ program opens a device handle, sends crafted IOCTL requests to kill selected processes, downloads a binary over WinINet, and executes it from a temporary path. It also includes shellcode loading logic through executable memory allocation. The code is most relevant for BYOVD threat simulation, incident response training, and defensive research on endpoint tampering techniques.
