This project is a compact signature dump for locating key Unreal Engine and game-specific offsets. It provides byte patterns for objects and routines such as world pointers, name pools, event dispatching, visibility checks, and aiming-related functions. The content is plain text and intended for manual or scripted updater pipelines. Its primary use case is maintaining external or internal game analysis tools that rely on fast offset updates.
