This project is a forensic NTFS parser suite that links artifacts across MFT, LogFile, and UsnJrnl data sources.
It provides command-line tools for record export, transaction parsing, data extraction, and combined proof-of-concept timeline analysis.
The implementation is written in Python with modular parsers, helper scripts, and structured output formats such as parsed text and CSV.
It is intended for digital forensics and file-system research rather than game cheating or anti-cheat bypass work.
