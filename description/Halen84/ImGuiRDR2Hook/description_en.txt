ImGuiRDR2Hook is a Red Dead Redemption 2 hook framework for rendering custom ImGui menus through Vulkan and DirectX 12. It is implemented in C++ and integrates common hooking components such as MinHook, Kiero, and Dear ImGui to intercept rendering paths. The codebase provides hook entry points, render routines, configuration handling, and practical notes for stable menu drawing and input behavior. It is mainly used for game overlay development, graphics API hooking practice, and game security experimentation.
