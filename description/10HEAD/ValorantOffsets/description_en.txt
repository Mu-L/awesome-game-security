This project is a lightweight offset pack that tracks memory and function offsets for VALORANT.
It provides C/C++-style constants for engine functions and gameplay-related structures used by external tooling.
The repository is intentionally minimal and focused on quick updates after game patches.
Its primary use case is game reverse engineering and maintenance of analysis or automation tools that depend on current offsets.
