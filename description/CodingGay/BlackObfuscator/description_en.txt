This project is a DEX control-flow obfuscation tool for Android applications.
It is written mainly in Java and is based on a modified dex2jar pipeline to transform bytecode without changing app behavior.
The tool supports configurable obfuscation depth, package targeting, and rule-based processing, and it also has companion GUI and Android Studio plugin integrations.
It is intended for mobile application protection and reverse-engineering resistance research.
