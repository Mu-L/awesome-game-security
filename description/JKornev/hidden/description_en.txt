Hidden is a Windows kernel driver with a user-mode interface for concealing selected system artifacts.
The C and C++ code supports hiding files, directories, registry keys, and processes, and can also protect chosen processes from interference.
It includes CLI and library components to configure rules and exceptions, plus build scripts for WDK-based development.
The project targets reverse engineering labs and security research scenarios that require controlled environment masking.
