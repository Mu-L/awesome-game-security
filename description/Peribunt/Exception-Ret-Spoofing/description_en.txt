This project is a minimal proof of concept for x64 return-address spoofing implemented through an exception-handler flow. The C++ example demonstrates how a spoofed call path can be built and chained with gadgets while documenting practical tradeoffs. It highlights both the convenience and the calling-convention constraints that affect reliability and performance. The code is mainly useful for low-level control-flow research in anti-cheat evasion and offensive tooling experiments.
