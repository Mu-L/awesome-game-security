This project is the source release of NVIDIA PhysX, a real-time physics SDK for games and interactive simulation.
It includes multi-platform rigid-body and collision systems, sample applications, documentation, and integration material used by major game engines.
The codebase is predominantly C++ with CMake and Python-driven build generation across Windows, Linux, Android, and Apple platforms.
It is aimed at engine and gameplay developers who need production-grade physics technology for game development and related simulation research.
