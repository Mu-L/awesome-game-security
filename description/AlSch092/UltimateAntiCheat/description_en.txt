This project is an open source Windows anti-cheat framework built mainly in C++. It focuses on user-mode detection and prevention of common game tampering vectors such as debugging, memory patching, and suspicious runtime modifications. The codebase includes optional client-server heartbeat networking and configurable paths for hybrid user-mode plus kernel-assisted deployments. It is primarily intended as an educational reference for developers and researchers building or evaluating anti-cheat systems.
