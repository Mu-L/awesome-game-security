This project is a driver-plus-DLL technique for obtaining process handles while bypassing kernel handle callbacks. It is implemented in C and C++ and uses ObOpenPointerToObject in kernel mode, with a user-mode OpenProcess hook forwarding requests through IOCTLs. This allows tools like debuggers to attach to callback-protected processes where normal handle creation paths are blocked, while still noting limitations such as PPL targets. It is mainly for Windows security research on anti-cheat or EDR handle protection mechanisms.
