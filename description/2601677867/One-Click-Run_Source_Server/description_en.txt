This project is a one-click shell script for deploying Source engine dedicated servers on Linux.
It automates environment checks, dependency installation, SteamCMD setup, and game server download steps for distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS.
The script also helps install common Source server components such as Sourcemod and Metamod while providing troubleshooting guidance for typical deployment errors.
Its primary use case is simplifying server setup for beginners and reducing repetitive manual work for experienced community server operators.
