This project distributes unofficial binary patches for a Palworld dedicated server to mitigate specific memory leak and CPU usage issues in older builds. It includes patch assets for Linux and Windows, plus batch scripts and hash verification steps to apply updates safely. Most of the repository is patching infrastructure and prebuilt binaries rather than source code, with supporting documentation in English and Chinese. It is mainly useful for server operators and researchers studying server stability fixes and early server-side anti-cheat experimentation.
