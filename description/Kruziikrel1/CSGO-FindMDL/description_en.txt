This project is an internal model changer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive based on a FindMDL hook.
It is implemented as a C++ DLL with hook logic, interface wrappers, offset handling, and VMT management utilities.
The repository includes Visual Studio project files and a typical injector-driven workflow for loading into the game process.
The source is structured so users can customize model replacement behavior and paths.
It is mainly intended for cheat development practice and game reverse-engineering research.
