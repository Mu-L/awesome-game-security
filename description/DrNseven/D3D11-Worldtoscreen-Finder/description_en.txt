This project is a Direct3D 11 world-to-screen finder for locating usable projection math in games. It is written mainly in C++ and uses DirectX 11 hooking with MinHook plus an ImGui in-game overlay. The tool helps brute-force and test matrix or constant-buffer combinations by drawing model-position text and logging matched targets. It is primarily used in game security and cheat research workflows to bootstrap ESP or aiming-related visual experiments.
