This repository is a Direct3D 11 hook-based wallhack project for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows games. It injects a DLL, hooks rendering paths, and provides a menu-driven workflow for identifying target models via stride and index count logging. The codebase uses C++ with common game-hacking libraries such as Detours and ImGui integration. It is primarily intended for cheat prototyping and graphics pipeline analysis in game security research.
