This project is a Direct3D 12 hooking sample that injects an ImGui overlay into DX12 games. It is implemented in C++ with DirectX 12 APIs and MinHook-style function interception patterns. The codebase demonstrates practical DLL build and injection flow, frame hook setup, and real-time menu rendering. It is mainly used for graphics API research, game overlay prototyping, and low-level game instrumentation studies.
