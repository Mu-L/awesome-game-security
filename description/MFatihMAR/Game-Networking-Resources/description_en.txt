This project is a curated knowledge base of multiplayer game networking resources. It is primarily a Markdown collection organizing articles, talks, libraries, and tools around netcode topics such as latency compensation, rollback, prediction, and replication. The content spans practical engineering references across different engines, languages, and architecture styles. The main use case is helping developers and researchers study game networking design and implementation tradeoffs.
