This project is a Windows kernel proof of concept for interfering with PatchGuard execution behavior. It includes a driver and low-level assembly hook logic that observes or short-circuits specific dispatch paths in protected routines. The implementation is focused on Win8 through Win10-era systems and documents call-chain analysis from kernel debugging sessions. It is intended for kernel security and anti-cheat researchers studying PatchGuard internals and bypass concepts.
