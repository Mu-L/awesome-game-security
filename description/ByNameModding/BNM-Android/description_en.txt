This project is a C++20 library for modding Android Unity IL2CPP games by class, method, and field names. It provides helper abstractions for runtime access, patching, and integration with common Android hooking frameworks. The repository documents supported Unity versions and includes dependencies focused on text handling and lightweight RTTI behavior. It is aimed at mobile game modding and reverse engineering researchers who want a reusable foundation instead of one-off patches.
