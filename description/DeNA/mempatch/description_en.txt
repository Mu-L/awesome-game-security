mempatch is a tool for modifying memory values of applications running on Android devices. It is implemented in C++ with Android NDK support and includes components for address handling, patching, snapshots, range tracking, and optional value freezing workflows. The repository also contains platform abstraction code and test assets that help validate memory editing behavior across environments. It is intended for vulnerability assessment and development support scenarios rather than use against released production apps.
