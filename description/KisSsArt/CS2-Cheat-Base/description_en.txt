This project is a Windows DirectX cheat base for Counter-Strike 2 that is built as an injectable DLL.
It provides hook and rendering infrastructure with configurable gameplay modules such as ESP and bunny hop.
The implementation is mainly C++ and integrates common tooling like ImGui, kiero, and JSON-based configuration.
The documented build process targets Visual Studio x64 release output with manual-map style injection.
It is intended as a starter framework for cheat development and practical game security research.
