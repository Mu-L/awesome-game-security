This project is a Minecraft Bedrock anti-cheat behavior pack designed for realms, worlds, and servers.
It is primarily built with JavaScript and JSON using the Bedrock Scripting API and command/function files.
The pack includes many detection modules for combat, movement, packet abuse, chat spam, scaffold behavior, and other common cheats, plus moderation commands and player stats tools.
Its primary use case is server-side cheat detection and moderation workflow improvement for Bedrock administrators.
