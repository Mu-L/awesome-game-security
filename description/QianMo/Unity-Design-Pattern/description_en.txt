This project is a Unity C# design-pattern library that demonstrates classic object-oriented and game-specific patterns in runnable scenes.
It contains implementations of all 23 GoF patterns plus selected game programming patterns, each with structure examples and practical use cases.
The repository is organized by pattern category and includes diagrams, sample scripts, and Unity scenes for hands-on learning.
It is aimed at Unity developers who want to apply maintainable architecture patterns in real game code.
