This project is a large collection of game programming study notes focused on graphics and real-time rendering topics.
Most content is written in Markdown with extensive diagrams and media, covering subjects such as GPU Gems, shader programming, ray tracing, and post-processing.
It also includes software engineering and design-oriented material relevant to practical game development.
The primary audience is learners and developers who want structured references for game graphics and engine-related concepts.
