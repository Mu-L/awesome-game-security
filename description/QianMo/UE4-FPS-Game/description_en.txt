This project is an Unreal Engine 4 sample game project that demonstrates a C++ gameplay module with standard character control.
It combines Unreal C++ classes with Blueprint assets, input bindings, camera setup, and starter content maps.
The code follows the typical UE4 module and target layout and serves as a compact example of engine project structure.
It is mainly intended for beginners practicing UE4 C++ gameplay programming and editor workflow basics.
