This project is an Unreal Engine 4 tank game prototype that mixes C++ gameplay logic with Blueprint scenes and assets.
It implements core classes such as a tank pawn, player controller, and AI controller, including aiming and crosshair-based targeting flow.
The project includes multiple maps and packaged art content to support iterative gameplay testing.
It is best suited for learners studying UE4 architecture, controller patterns, and game prototype development.
