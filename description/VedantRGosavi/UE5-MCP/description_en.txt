This project is a documentation-first concept for connecting AI automation workflows across Blender and Unreal Engine 5.
The repository is mostly Markdown design and workflow documents rather than a production code implementation.
It outlines features such as text-driven scene generation, asset transfer, level automation, and Blueprint assistance.
The authors note development was paused, so the main value is as a reference for game pipeline and AI tooling research.
