Blackbone is a Windows memory hacking library for advanced process manipulation and code injection workflows. It supports x86 and x64 targets and provides APIs for memory allocation, read and write operations, protection changes, module enumeration, manual PE mapping, and thread control across WOW64 boundaries. The project includes both user mode and kernel related capabilities that make it suitable for low level internals work. It is primarily used in reverse engineering, game security research, and anti cheat related tooling experiments.
