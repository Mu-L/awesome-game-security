This project is an experimental C++ library for detecting EPT-based memory hooks from user mode. It combines vectored exception handling, CPU intrinsics, and a VPGATHER-based accessibility technique to probe whether pages are being manipulated by a hypervisor. The implementation is presented as a proof of concept and focuses on stealthier checks for executable and readable page state transitions. Its main audience is anti-cheat and virtualization security researchers studying hypervisor hook detection.
