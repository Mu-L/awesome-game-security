This project is a collection of Cheat Engine tables and auto-assembler scripts for MapleStory v179.
The scripts implement gameplay modifications such as full-map attack, skill injection, no-delay variants, pet loot teleport behavior, and knockback-related tweaks.
Content is provided as CEA and CT scripts that patch in-memory instructions through pattern scans and byte edits.
It is intended for cheat development practice and legacy MapleStory reverse engineering experiments.
