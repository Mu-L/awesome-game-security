This repository is an archive of Unity IL2CPP runtime source code across multiple Unity generation ranges.
It contains extensive C and C++ implementation files for libil2cpp internals, including runtime services, metadata handling, garbage collection, and platform abstraction layers.
The included version mapping notes help correlate IL2CPP revisions with corresponding Unity engine releases.
It is primarily used by reverse engineers and game security researchers who need reference internals for Unity native code analysis and tooling development.
