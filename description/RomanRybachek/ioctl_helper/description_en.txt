This project is a desktop utility for sending custom IOCTL requests to Windows drivers. It is built in C++ with Qt Widgets and includes an integrated hex editor interface to craft input buffers and inspect output data. The application supports opening multiple device objects, managing handles, and issuing DeviceIoControl calls with configurable control codes and buffer sizes. It is useful for driver reversing, kernel communication testing, and game security research workflows.
