LibreHardwareMonitor is an open-source hardware telemetry project that provides both a Windows desktop monitor and a reusable .NET library.
It is primarily written in C# and reads temperatures, fan speeds, voltages, loads, and clock data from CPUs, GPUs, storage devices, and other components.
The project ships with WinForms UI code and library APIs that can be integrated into other applications.
Its main use case is system diagnostics and sensor collection, and it is often useful in game performance monitoring or environment-aware security tooling.
