This project is a Windows kernel research proof of concept for bypassing Driver Signature Enforcement and PatchGuard through a BYOVD attack model.
It combines C++ code with detailed reversing notes that trace signature validation callbacks and integrity-check execution paths in modern Windows kernels.
The material highlights how vulnerable signed drivers can be leveraged to interfere with code integrity decisions and patch-protection behavior.
It is intended for educational kernel security analysis and for defenders studying realistic BYOVD attack surfaces and mitigations.
