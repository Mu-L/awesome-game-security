This project is an Android and Linux kernel driver that exposes process memory read and write operations through a device interface. It is primarily written in C and implements ioctl commands for memory access, module base lookup, and request dispatching. The repository includes kernel module build files and user-space components for communicating with the driver. It is mainly used for low-level game memory research, reverse engineering experiments, and kernel-side tooling studies.
