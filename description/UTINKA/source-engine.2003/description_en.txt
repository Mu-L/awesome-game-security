This project is a large archival snapshot of an early Source engine codebase with Half-Life 2 era game modules and tools. It contains extensive engine, client, server, rendering, and utility code in C and C++ with legacy Visual Studio project files. The tree includes subsystems such as material and graphics components, game DLL logic, and build scripts for historical Windows toolchains. It is mainly useful as a reference corpus for engine internals study, reverse engineering, and legacy game security research.
