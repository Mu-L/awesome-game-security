This project is a plugin that adds Python 3 scripting support to the x64dbg debugger.
It is built in C++ and exposes debugger functionality through Python-friendly wrappers that mirror common plugin SDK APIs.
The repository includes example scripts for memory access, assembly tasks, module inspection, and GUI interactions, making automation easier for repetitive reversing workflows.
Its main use case is reverse engineering and debugger automation for analysts who want to script x86 and x64 debugging tasks.
