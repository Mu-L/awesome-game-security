This project is a Linux anti-debugging detection tool implemented in C. It checks multiple indicators including ptrace behavior, LD_PRELOAD tampering, and TracerPid values in /proc/self/status. The detection logic is designed to execute early and report likely debugging conditions with simple runtime checks. The primary use case is anti-analysis research and defensive hardening experiments for Linux binaries.
