This project is an external cheat framework for Valorant focused on aimbot and ESP capabilities. It is implemented mostly in C++ and includes supporting pieces for memory interaction, rendering overlays, and hardware ID spoofing related workflows. The repository advertises driver-assisted operation and bundled tooling for bypass-oriented setups. Its primary audience is offensive game-hacking research rather than defensive anti-cheat engineering.
