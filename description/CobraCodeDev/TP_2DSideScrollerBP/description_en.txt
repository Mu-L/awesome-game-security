This project is an Unreal Engine 5 blueprint template for building 2D side-scroller games. It provides a starter project structure, sample assets, and setup guidance for Paper2D-style workflows. The template is versioned for newer UE5 releases and references optional advanced variants that use the PaperZD plugin for animation tooling. It is aimed at game developers prototyping side-scrolling gameplay rather than security research.
