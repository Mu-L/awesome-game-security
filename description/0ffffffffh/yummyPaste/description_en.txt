This project is a debugger plugin that pastes binary byte data from text directly into memory views. It supports multiple input formats such as C-style byte arrays, escaped shellcode strings, comma-separated decimals, and space-separated decimal sequences. The implementation is in C++ and integrates with the x64dbg plugin SDK for disassembler and dump window workflows. It is useful for reverse engineers and exploit developers who need quick patching and byte injection during analysis.
