This project is a custom Xbox 360 dumping utility that collects console data required by low-level emulation workflows. It is implemented mainly in C/C++ and includes code for extracting fuses, bootloader content, and NAND-related artifacts. The tool is designed for modified retail or developer environments where privileged access is available. Its primary use case is console reverse engineering, preservation, and emulator preparation research.
