This project is a Windows utility that converts windowed games into borderless fullscreen sessions.
It is built in C# and .NET with a WinForms interface plus a separate logic layer for process watching, window manipulation, and startup behavior.
The codebase includes language packs, Steam-related components, and installer scripts for standalone deployment.
Its main use case is improving PC gaming usability with faster task switching and fewer issues than exclusive fullscreen modes.
