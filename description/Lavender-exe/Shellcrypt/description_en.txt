Shellcrypt is a cross-platform shellcode obfuscation utility that transforms raw payload bytes into ready-to-paste source code formats.
It is implemented in Python and supports multiple encryption ciphers including AES, ChaCha20, RC4, Salsa20, and XOR variants.
The tool can chain encoding and compression stages, then emit output for languages such as C, C#, Go, Rust, Nim, Python, and PowerShell.
It is mainly used in offensive security and game security research workflows for payload packing, format conversion, and loader prototyping.
