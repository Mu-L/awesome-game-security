This project is a Windows kernel driver focused on read/write process memory functionality for low-level tooling. It is written in C++ and exposes routines for module base/export lookup, kernel memory access, and writing to protected memory regions. The notes indicate mapper-based loading and mention dxgkrnl-related hooking context for operation. It is primarily used for game security research into driver-assisted memory access and anti-cheat bypass techniques.
