This project is the community plugin index for Binary Ninja.
It aggregates third-party plugin metadata, licensing, compatibility information, and update history into machine-readable listings.
The repository uses Python tooling to validate plugin manifests, generate index files, and automate catalog maintenance.
Its primary use case is helping reverse engineers discover, install, and manage community-contributed Binary Ninja extensions.
