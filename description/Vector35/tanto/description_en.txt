This project is a Binary Ninja plugin for program slicing to speed up code comprehension during reverse engineering.
It is written mainly in Python and integrates with Binary Ninja UI views and intermediate-language representations.
The plugin helps users inspect variable and block relationships through focused slices instead of full-function complexity.
Its target audience is analysts and vulnerability researchers who need faster navigation of complex binaries.
