This project is the curated official plugin index for Binary Ninja extensions maintained by the core team.
It stores structured metadata for supported plugins, including descriptions, plugin types, API targets, and license details.
Python-based indexing scripts generate and refresh catalog outputs used by plugin management workflows.
It is mainly used by Binary Ninja users who want trusted first-party or endorsed plugin integrations.
