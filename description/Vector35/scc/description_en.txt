This project is an open-source shellcode compiler that was integrated into Binary Ninja after being developed as an internal CTF tool.
It is primarily written in C/C++ and built with CMake.
The compiler focuses on producing compact shellcode-oriented output and includes dedicated documentation for usage and builds.
It is most useful for exploit development and reverse engineering workflows that require controlled low-level code generation.
