This project is a curated list of Ghidra ecosystem resources for reverse engineering. It is primarily a Markdown collection of scripts, plugins, extensions, and reference material spanning automation, malware analysis, diffing, and workflow enhancements. The listed tools cover both Java and Python based extensions and include options for headless and interactive usage. It is mainly useful for reverse engineers and game security researchers who want a quick map of practical Ghidra tooling.
