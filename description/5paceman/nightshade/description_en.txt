This project is a Windows internal game framework for injection, runtime hooking, and modular feature toggling. It is written in C++ and includes components for Direct3D rendering hooks, DirectInput interception, pattern scanning, memory patching, and shellcode-assisted remote execution. The codebase is organized around a module interface and manager so features can be initialized, drawn, updated, and hot-toggled by keybinds. It is mainly useful for reverse-engineering practice and cheat or anti-cheat research on user-mode game internals.
