SKRoot is an Android-focused Linux kernel root patching toolkit designed to provide deeply hidden root capabilities.
It combines C and C++ patching components with Java and JNI-based app tooling for permission management and deployment workflows.
The project advertises features such as root command execution, su installation and injection, and compatibility across many kernel versions without rebuilding the kernel from source.
It is mainly used in mobile game and app security research for studying root detection, bypass behavior, and kernel-level privilege control.
