This project is an IDA Pro plugin that embeds an AI assistant directly inside the reverse engineering interface. It is primarily Python-based and includes configurable model backends, command prompts, and UI actions for interactive analysis. Built-in capabilities include function explanation, symbol renaming, and Go binary parsing helpers such as pclntab reconstruction workflows. Its main use case is speeding up repetitive reverse engineering tasks for security researchers.
