This project is a cross-platform low-level 3D graphics library and rendering framework. It provides a unified API across Direct3D 11/12, Vulkan, Metal, OpenGL, OpenGLES, WebGL, and WebGPU, with HLSL used as a common shader language. The engine emphasizes modular C++ design, multithreaded command and resource workflows, advanced rendering features, and tooling around render state management. It is primarily used by game engine and visualization developers, including security researchers who need portable graphics infrastructure for instrumentation or overlays.
