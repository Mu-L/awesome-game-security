This project is a return-oriented programming compiler used to build game cheat payloads for CSGO, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 4.
It takes custom x86 assembly-like scripts and translates them into ROP chains, with gadget scanning and offset handling implemented in C++.
The codebase includes practical examples such as triggerbot, glow ESP, and minimap spotting logic.
Its primary use case is game security research into exploit-style cheat execution and anti-cheat evasion techniques.
