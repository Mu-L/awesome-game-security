This project is a DLL-based hook tool for Windows code-signing utilities. It uses C++ and Microsoft Detours to intercept certificate validity checks and timestamp-related signing APIs. The design allows redirection to custom timestamp endpoints and modified time behavior through configuration or command-line parameters. It is aimed at research and testing around digital-signing workflows, certificate validation logic, and timestamp handling.
