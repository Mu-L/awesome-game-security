This project demonstrates loading an EFI driver during boot to provide privileged memory access in Windows sessions.
It includes an EFI-side runtime module and a user-space client that issues read, write, and process-base requests.
The implementation mixes C/C++ with GNU-EFI and Visual Studio components and documents build and boot workflow details.
It is primarily intended for kernel and anti-cheat bypass research involving pre-OS execution paths.
