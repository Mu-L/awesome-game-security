This project is a kernel-assisted external cheat framework targeting Apex Legends.
It combines a Windows kernel driver for memory read and write, a C++ user-mode controller, and a transparent overlay for ESP-style visuals and aiming logic.
The workflow relies on vulnerable-driver mapping techniques to load the kernel component.
It is mainly used for cheat development and anti-cheat bypass research.
