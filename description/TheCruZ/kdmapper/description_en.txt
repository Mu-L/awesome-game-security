This project is a utility for mapping unsigned Windows kernel drivers by exploiting a vulnerable Intel driver pathway.
It provides multiple mapping options, trace-reduction steps for common kernel bookkeeping structures, and compatibility support across many modern Windows builds.
The codebase is C++ and includes helper projects for symbol and offset handling, including PDB-driven workflows.
It is widely used in kernel research, driver testing, and anti-cheat bypass experimentation.
