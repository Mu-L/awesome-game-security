This project is a broad collection of Linux rootkit-oriented code samples spanning kernel space, user space, and eBPF.
Most implementations are in C and demonstrate techniques such as file and connection hiding, syscall and ftrace hooking, privilege escalation, persistence, and anti-forensic behavior.
The repository is organized into many focused subprojects with build scripts and small write-ups that explain each mechanism.
Its main use case is educational offensive and defensive research, including anti-rootkit detection testing and kernel security experimentation.
