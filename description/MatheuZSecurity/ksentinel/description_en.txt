This project is a Linux kernel integrity monitor that watches syscall and critical function hooks for signs of rootkit tampering.
It is implemented in C as a loadable kernel module and uses function prologue hashing, syscall table validation, and LSTAR checks to detect unauthorized modifications.
The tool supports configurable monitoring intervals, extra symbol targets, and an anti-unload mechanism with an unlock key workflow.
Its primary audience is kernel security researchers and defenders evaluating rootkit detection strategies on Linux systems.
