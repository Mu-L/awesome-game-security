This project is an IDA 9.0 SDK-adapted build of the ScyllaHide anti-anti-debugging suite. It is a large C/C++ codebase containing hook libraries, injector components, and debugger plugins for environments such as IDA and other Windows reversing tools. The implementation focuses on masking debugger artifacts and bypassing common anti-debug checks in protected binaries. It is mainly used by reverse engineers and malware analysts who need more stable debugging against hostile or obfuscated targets.
