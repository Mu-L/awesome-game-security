This project is an external Counter-Strike 2 cheat framework implemented in C++. It includes modules for ESP variants, aimbot logic with recoil control, triggerbot, radar, bunnyhop, visibility checks, and offset management. The project uses an external ImGui-based UI stack and process memory interaction utilities to drive runtime features. It is primarily intended for educational reverse engineering and game security research into external cheat design and anti-cheat response.
