This project is a Linux deployment guide and script set for running a dedicated multiplayer game server. It relies on shell scripts, SteamCMD, and systemd service files to install, update, start, back up, and restore server data. The workflow is tailored for Debian and Ubuntu and includes operational steps for maintenance automation. It is mainly useful for server administrators rather than anti-cheat or reverse-engineering research.
