This project is a tutorial-driven codebase that walks through building a custom x86 hypervisor step by step. It contains C, C++, and assembly examples split across progressive parts covering VMX setup, VMCS management, EPT translation, and virtualization of running systems. The repository pairs practical source code with staged learning material to explain modern hardware virtualization internals. It is primarily for low-level systems programmers and security researchers learning hypervisor-based analysis techniques.
