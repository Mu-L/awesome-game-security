This project is a Windows kernel driver framework and template for low-level system programming and research.
It is primarily written in modern C++ and includes hypervisor-assisted components for Intel VT-x and AMD-V environments.
The framework exposes abstractions for memory operations, IOCTL handling, hooks, CPUID and MSR interactions, and other kernel primitives.
It is commonly used in advanced debugging, monitoring, and anti-cheat related kernel security research.
