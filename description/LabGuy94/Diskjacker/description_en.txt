Diskjacker is a proof-of-concept project that hijacks Hyper-V VM-exit handling at runtime using a DMA-based approach.
It combines C++ kernel and usermode components with assembly stubs for low-level mapping and execution transfer.
The workflow depends on specific virtualization and hardware conditions and demonstrates adaptation of DDMA-style primitives to hypervisor research.
It is aimed at kernel and virtualization security researchers rather than general application developers.
