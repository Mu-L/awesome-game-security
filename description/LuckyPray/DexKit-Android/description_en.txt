This project is a high-performance Android dex deobfuscation library designed for native-assisted code discovery. It combines C++ NDK components with JNI and Kotlin-facing integration to search classes and methods by strings, relations, and opcode patterns. The library supports Gradle distribution, prefab packaging, and CMake linking for practical embedding in Android projects. It is mainly used in Android reverse engineering workflows such as app analysis, hook point discovery, and obfuscated code navigation.
