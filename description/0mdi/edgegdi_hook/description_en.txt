This project is a proof of concept for hooking GDI behavior through an EdgeGDI-related data section pointer patch. It uses C++ pattern scanning and runtime pointer replacement to intercept exported GDI32-related functionality such as BitBlt paths. The repository includes implementation code and a small test harness, with notes and screenshots from specific Windows 10 builds. It is mainly relevant to graphics-hook research and low-level anti-cheat evasion analysis where minimizing code-section patching is important.
