Atmosphere is a custom firmware platform for the Nintendo Switch that replaces or patches multiple boot and runtime system components. The codebase is largely C and C++ with low-level platform code for loaders, TrustZone behavior, sysmodules, and emulated NAND support. It is organized into modular parts such as Fusee, Exosphere, Stratosphere, and related development libraries. The project is mainly used by console security researchers and homebrew developers who need deep system-level control.
