This project is a hands-on game engine learning book with a large accompanying codebase. It is centered on C++ and OpenGL, and walks through engine construction from rendering basics to animation, GUI, audio, profiling, and multithreaded rendering. The repository includes many chapter-based samples and supporting technologies such as Lua scripting integration, Blender export workflows, and FMOD-related audio steps. Its primary use case is teaching game engine architecture to learners who want practical implementation experience.
