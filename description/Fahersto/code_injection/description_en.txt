This project is a C++ collection of host-based code injection techniques for Windows. It includes around two dozen PE, DLL, and shellcode injection implementations such as hollowing variants, callback-based methods, and loader abuse paths. Build scripts organize each technique as a separate executable and include compatibility notes across 32-bit, 64-bit, WoW64, and multiple Windows versions. The primary audience is security researchers studying offensive tradecraft and defensive detection coverage.
