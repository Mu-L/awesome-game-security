DFoundryFX is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that adds real time in viewport performance tooling for game projects. It provides customizable metric charts, shader compilation monitoring, and quick STAT command controls without requiring extra actors to be placed in a level. The plugin is implemented with Unreal C++ modules and is intended to remain available directly during gameplay and profiling sessions. It is mainly used by developers who need lightweight runtime diagnostics and performance tuning support.
