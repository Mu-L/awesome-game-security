This project is a DLL-based proof of concept that attempts to interfere with Valve Anti-Cheat checks in the Steam service context.
The C++ implementation uses signature scanning and Detours hooks to patch internal routines and spoof selected Windows API responses.
It hooks functions such as VirtualQuery, process and module enumeration, debugger checks, and memory read paths to reduce scanner visibility.
The repository is archived as non-working and mainly serves as historical anti-cheat bypass research material.
