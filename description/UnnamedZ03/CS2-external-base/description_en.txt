This project is a basic external framework for Counter-Strike 2 overlay visualization features. It includes examples such as team checks and multiple ESP outputs for box, health, distance, skeleton, and text displays. The code is written in C++ and focuses on overlay-side structure while intentionally omitting memory read/write driver components. It is positioned as an educational starter base for studying external tooling architecture in game security contexts.
