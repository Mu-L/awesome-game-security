YimMenu is now a documentation-focused repository for Lua scripting interfaces and support features related to the menu ecosystem.
The original source code was removed, and the remaining content centers on Lua API references, command documentation, and utility guides.
It includes practical setup instructions for services such as LibreTranslate used by the chat translation feature.
The repository is most useful for script developers and users maintaining Lua-based extensions rather than core menu development.
