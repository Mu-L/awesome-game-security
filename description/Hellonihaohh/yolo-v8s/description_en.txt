This repository is a lightweight distribution package for a YOLOv8s model artifact rather than a full implementation codebase. The archived content includes only license information and a compressed model file, with no README or training and inference scripts. Its primary role is to provide pretrained detection assets for other projects, including game-focused computer vision experiments.
