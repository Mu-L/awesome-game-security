This project is an external ESP cheat for Counter-Strike 2. It reads game memory externally and renders boxes, names, and health overlays through a GDI-based window, with support for offset maintenance and update scripts. The codebase is primarily C++ on Visual Studio and includes components for memory handling, handle hijacking, and JSON-based configuration. It is intended for game-hacking experimentation and learning external cheat architecture.
