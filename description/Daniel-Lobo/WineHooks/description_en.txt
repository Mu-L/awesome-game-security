WineHooks is a game compatibility and enhancement framework that injects hooks into legacy PC titles. It combines DirectX and OpenGL interception, resolution scaling, texture replacement, audio and input fixes, and many game specific patch profiles for modern systems. The repository mixes C or C++ components with automation and configuration assets, and it is built to run on both native Windows and Linux through Wine. It is mainly used by modders and reverse engineering practitioners who need practical hooks for restoring or extending old game behavior.
