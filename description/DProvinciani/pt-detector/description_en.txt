This project is a Windows research prototype for detecting code-reuse exploits using Intel Processor Trace data. It combines kernel and user-mode components to collect trace packets, then decodes execution streams to identify suspicious control-flow behavior associated with techniques like ROP or JOP. The implementation uses C/C++ for capture infrastructure and Python tooling for interpretation and analysis support. It is targeted at exploit detection research and control-flow integrity experimentation.
