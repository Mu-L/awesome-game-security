This project is the archived codebase of a security incident response and case management platform used in SOC workflows.
It contains a substantial Scala backend and web frontend components, along with client libraries and integration-facing modules.
The repository now serves as a historical snapshot, and the maintainers indicate newer maintained editions are distributed separately.
Its primary use case is studying legacy incident handling architecture and operational security workflows.
