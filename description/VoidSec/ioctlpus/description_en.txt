This project is a Windows tool for crafting and replaying DeviceIoControl requests against kernel drivers. It is written in C# with both WinForms GUI and CLI modes, allowing arbitrary input and output buffer control similar to a repeater workflow. The application helps users save, edit, and rerun ioctl payloads while inspecting responses during testing. Its primary use case is driver security research, ioctl interface auditing, and fuzzing preparation.
