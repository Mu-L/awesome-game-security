This project is a reverse-engineered study of a mobile game anti-cheat implementation and its native protection logic. It includes reconstructed C/C++ code for components such as CPU and emulator checks, Dex-related handling, utility routines, and encrypted loading behavior. The code and notes focus on how detection paths are triggered and how internal anti-tamper routines are structured in practice. It is mainly useful for game security researchers who want to understand Android anti-cheat internals and evaluate potential bypass surfaces in a controlled research context.
