This project is a long-form reverse-engineering report on an Android app protection product. It analyzes Java and native components, detection logic, telemetry behavior, dex-loading design, and practical bypass surfaces discovered during testing. The document discusses techniques such as anti-debug checks, process-kill routines, and hook-based bypass validation from a research perspective. It is intended for mobile game and app security researchers evaluating shielding quality and detection robustness.
