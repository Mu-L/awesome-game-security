This project is a public game launcher for World of Warcraft clients that can connect to custom servers using valid TLS certificates. It is built primarily in C# on .NET and supports multiple client branches with configurable client versions and CDN endpoints. The public build intentionally removes developer mode, mod loading, and other advanced tooling present in the full edition. It is mainly aimed at private server operations and client compatibility testing.
