This project is a feature expansion mod for the Arma 3 Eden Editor.
It is built with SQF scripts, config definitions, and addon modules that add editor UI tools, mission attributes, and workflow shortcuts.
The mod is designed so scenarios can be played without hard dependencies on the editing extension.
It mainly serves mission makers and modders who want a more productive Arma 3 editing environment.
