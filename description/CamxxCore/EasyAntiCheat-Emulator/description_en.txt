This project is a lightweight Windows DLL that emulates the local EasyAntiCheat interface expected by some games. It is developed in C++ and provides fake client-side exports so binaries can proceed as if the anti-cheat module is present. The repository describes it as a debugging-oriented stub and does not implement real server-side protocol spoofing. It is mainly aimed at reverse engineering and controlled anti-cheat compatibility testing.
