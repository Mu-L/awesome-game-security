This project is an Android ART method hooking framework for Java method replacement and interception. It combines Java and native components to provide backup-and-hook APIs, architecture support across common Android ABIs, and examples for static, virtual, JNI, and framework method hooks. The repository includes a reusable library plus demo app and plugin modules that show real hook deployment workflows. It is mainly used for Android runtime instrumentation, security research, and dynamic behavior modification.
