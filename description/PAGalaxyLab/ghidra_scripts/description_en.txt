This project is a collection of Python scripts for the Ghidra reverse engineering suite. It includes utilities for tracing function parameters with P-Code, analyzing Objective-C message dispatch, renaming functions from error-print patterns, and deobfuscating OLLVM control-flow flattening. The scripts are organized with shared helper modules and documentation examples for practical firmware and binary analysis tasks. It is intended for reverse engineers and game security analysts who automate repetitive static analysis workflows.
