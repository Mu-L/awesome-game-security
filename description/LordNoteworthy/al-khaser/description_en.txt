This project is a Windows proof-of-concept anti-analysis test suite that simulates many malware evasion behaviors. The codebase is mainly C++ and implements anti-debugging, anti-VM, anti-dumping, anti-disassembly, and timing-based checks through a command-line interface. It includes broad environment detection coverage for platforms and tools such as VirtualBox, VMware, QEMU, Wine, and common analysis workflows. The main use case is validating sandbox, EDR, and anti-malware visibility against real-world evasion techniques.
