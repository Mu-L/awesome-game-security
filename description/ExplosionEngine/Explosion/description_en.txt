This project is a cross-platform C++ game engine with an ECS-oriented architecture. It targets modern graphics backends such as Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal, and provides editor and runtime modules with a CMake and Conan based build workflow. The repository combines engine code with tooling and frontend components, including Qt and web-stack dependencies, for production-style development workflows. It is aimed at game development teams and rendering researchers who need a full engine framework rather than a cheat-focused toolkit.
