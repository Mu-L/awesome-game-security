This project converts PHNT Native API headers into IDA-compatible type resources for reverse engineering. It provides generated IDC scripts and TIL libraries for both 32-bit and 64-bit workflows, based on modern Windows SDK and PHNT definitions. The tooling is centered on C/C++ header processing with IDA utilities such as idaclang and tilib. It is primarily used by reverse engineers who need richer Windows internal types and function prototypes when analyzing system binaries, drivers, or anti-cheat components.
