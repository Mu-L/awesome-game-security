This project is a large internal C++ cheat framework for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It includes a broad feature set such as aimbot, triggerbot, backtrack, ESP, chams, glow, radar, prediction systems, and many visual/world modifications. The architecture relies on SDK wrappers, hook-driven feature modules, configuration tooling, and rendering integrations including DirectX-oriented pipelines. The primary use case is educational game-hacking research and experimentation with cheat client engineering.
