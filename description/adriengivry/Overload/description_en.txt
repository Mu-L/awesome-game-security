Overload is an open-source 3D game engine that includes both runtime systems and an integrated editor.
It is built primarily in modern C++ with Lua scripting support and offers rendering, physics, audio, profiling, and material tooling.
The project emphasizes usability and extensibility through documentation, sample projects, and a community-driven architecture.
For game security research, it provides a substantial engine codebase for studying attack surfaces, tooling internals, and defensive design patterns.
