This project is a kernel-mode DLL injector for Windows that injects a chosen DLL into newly created processes when kernel32 is loaded. The implementation is based on analysis of the Sirifef (Max++) rootkit technique and includes both driver and sample DLL components. It is developed in C/C++ with Visual Studio and WDK tooling and is documented as x86-focused. The repository is useful for studying kernel-assisted process injection and for defensive research on detecting or mitigating such behavior.
