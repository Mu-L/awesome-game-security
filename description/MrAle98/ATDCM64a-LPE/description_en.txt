This project is a local privilege escalation proof of concept targeting a vulnerable Windows driver. It is implemented in C++ with Visual Studio project files and accompanied by PowerShell and batch scripts to support deployment and execution steps. The exploit template demonstrates driver interaction and workflow preparation in a lab-oriented setup. Its primary use case is Windows kernel exploitation research, including studies relevant to anti-cheat and driver security hardening.
