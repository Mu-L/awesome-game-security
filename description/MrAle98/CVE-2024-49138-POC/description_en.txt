This project is a proof-of-concept Windows local privilege escalation exploit for CVE-2024-49138 in CLFS.sys.
It is implemented in C++ and includes a Visual Studio solution with resource files for building a 64-bit executable.
The code demonstrates kernel memory read/write primitives and token swapping to spawn a SYSTEM shell on tested Windows 11 builds.
Its main use case is vulnerability research, exploit analysis, and defensive validation of patch effectiveness.
