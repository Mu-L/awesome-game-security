This project is a small utility for copying certificate data from one PE file to another executable. It is written in C++ and parses PE headers to locate and duplicate the Authenticode security directory blob. The resulting file carries copied certificate metadata but does not become a valid trusted signature, which is useful for testing verifier behavior. It is intended for Windows security research on signature handling, tampering detection, and trust pipeline edge cases.
