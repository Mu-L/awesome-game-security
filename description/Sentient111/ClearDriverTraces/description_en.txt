This project is a Windows kernel driver for removing forensic traces left by loading other drivers. It contains C++ kernel-mode routines that target structures such as MmUnloadedDrivers, PiDDBCacheTable, and code integrity hash caches. The implementation relies on version-specific offsets and low-level kernel data structure manipulation. It is mainly used in anti-cheat and driver forensics research to study what artifacts are created and how detection logic can track them.
