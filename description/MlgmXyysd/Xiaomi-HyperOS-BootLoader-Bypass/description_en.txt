This project is a proof of concept for bypassing certain Xiaomi HyperOS bootloader account binding restrictions. The implementation is centered on PHP tooling and automation scripts, with Docker and shell helpers plus multilingual documentation. It leverages ADB-oriented interactions through related libraries to drive the unlock-related workflow in a reproducible way. The primary use case is mobile security research and validation of bootloader restriction weaknesses and mitigations.
