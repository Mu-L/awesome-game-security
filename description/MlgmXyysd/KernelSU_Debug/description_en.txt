This project is a modified Android kernel root solution based on KernelSU with debugging-oriented behavior changes. It combines kernel-side C code with Android app and build assets to provide root access management, profile control, and customized policy handling. The modifications include relaxed manager checks, permissive SELinux-oriented options, init script support, and broad root convenience features for testing workflows. It is mainly intended for Android security research, system debugging, and experimentation in rooted environments.
