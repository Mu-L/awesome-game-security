This project is an internal Apex Legends cheat base intended as a starting framework for feature development.
It provides hooking scaffolding, game and entity abstractions, math and utility types, and an ImGui-based menu layer.
The implementation is mostly C++ in a Visual Studio environment with Windows and DirectX integration.
It is aimed at cheat development practice and reverse engineering experimentation in FPS game contexts.
