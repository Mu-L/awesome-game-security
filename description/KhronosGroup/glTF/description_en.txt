glTF is a royalty-free specification project for efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models. The repository includes the core specification, extension registry content, conformance assets, and many sample files used across tooling and engines. Its content is primarily documentation and data formats such as Markdown, AsciiDoc, and JSON-based model descriptors. The main use case is helping engine, rendering, and asset-pipeline developers build interoperable 3D workflows.
