This project is a proof of concept for communication between user mode and kernel mode through the Windows Registry. It is written in C++ and includes both a KMDF driver component and a paired user-mode client application. The implementation explores techniques such as custom process attach handling and related low-level memory-management ideas noted by the author. It is mainly intended for Windows internals research and anti-cheat bypass experimentation.
