This project is a decompiled source-style snapshot of an EasyAntiCheat kernel driver binary. The archive contains large Hex-Rays-generated C output and headers that expose internal function prototypes and data structures. Its content focuses on low-level Windows kernel routines related to process memory operations, validation, and anti-cheat control paths. It is primarily used by reverse engineers and game security researchers for educational analysis of anti-cheat internals.
