This project is a kernel proof of concept showing how to reduce mapped-driver memory traces after kdmapper-based loading. It is implemented in C++ and discusses freeing mapped pages with routines such as MmFreePagesFromMdl and pool cleanup. The sample also demonstrates a data-pointer communication approach via NtUserGetObjectInformation and notes possible alternatives. It is mainly aimed at low-level anti-cheat bypass research and driver-mapping stealth experiments.
