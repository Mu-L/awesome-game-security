This project is a short technical proof of concept about MmCopyMemory behavior in Windows kernel anti-cheat contexts. It explains how memory scans can be performed and provides a minimal C++ example that patches a specific check path to alter scan handling. The repository is small and focused on one targeted mechanism rather than a full framework. It is primarily intended for anti-cheat bypass research and defensive understanding of kernel memory inspection techniques.
