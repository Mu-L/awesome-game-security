This project is an IDA debugger plugin that improves call stack reconstruction for Windows x64 debugging. Implemented in C++, it uses DbgHelp and StackWalk64 to collect more reliable stack frames than the default debugger view. The plugin loads into IDA as a DLL and runs automatically during debug sessions. It is useful for reverse engineers who need clearer execution traces when analyzing protected or complex binaries.
