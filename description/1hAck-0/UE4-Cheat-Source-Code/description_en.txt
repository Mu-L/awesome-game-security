This project is an educational Unreal Engine 4 cheat codebase and guide for learning common game-hacking workflows.
Its C++ source demonstrates features such as ESP overlays, aimbot logic, trigger behavior, and multiple gameplay manipulation techniques.
The repository also documents core techniques like function hooking and pattern scanning to explain how UE4-focused tooling is built.
Its primary use case is hands-on training and experimentation for game security and reverse engineering learners in controlled environments.
