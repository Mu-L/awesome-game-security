This project is an internal multi-feature cheat for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive on Windows.
Written primarily in C++17, it provides gameplay modules such as aimbot, ESP and snaplines, bunnyhop, and anti-flash.
The code is structured as an injected internal tool rather than an external overlay-only assistant.
Its primary use case is cheat development and reverse-engineering practice in competitive shooter environments.
