This project is a Frida-based tracing toolkit for observing Android smali instruction execution at runtime. It uses JavaScript and TypeScript agents to hook ART interpreter paths and emit detailed execution logs. The documentation explains how to locate architecture-specific offsets and registers with static analysis tools such as IDA before running traces. It is intended for Android reverse engineering and mobile security research focused on runtime behavior analysis.
