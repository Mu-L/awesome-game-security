This project is a small first-person shooter sample built with Unreal Engine 4.
It combines UE4 C++ classes with Blueprint assets, maps, and standard input and engine configuration files.
Most of the repository consists of Unreal asset content, with a lightweight native gameplay code layer.
Primary technologies are Unreal Engine 4, C++, and Blueprint tooling.
It is useful as a learning sandbox for FPS development and as a practical target for engine-level game research.
