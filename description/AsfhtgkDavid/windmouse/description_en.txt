WindMouse is a Python library that generates human-like mouse movement paths for automation tasks. It implements the WindMouse algorithm to produce curved, non-linear trajectories with variable speed instead of deterministic straight-line motion. The project supports multiple automation backends, including AutoHotkey and PyAutoGUI, and exposes tuning controls for movement physics. Its main use case is reducing behavioral bot detection risk in UI automation and game scripting.
