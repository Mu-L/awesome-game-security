This project is a Windows kernel technique that executes user-mode code in an arbitrary target process.
It chains a kernel APC with KeUserModeCallback, pivots execution through a driver I/O routine, and returns with controlled context restoration.
The C++ implementation avoids allocating RWX shellcode memory in the target process while still enabling callable user-mode execution.
Its main use case is advanced process injection research and evaluation of detection trade-offs in game security environments.
