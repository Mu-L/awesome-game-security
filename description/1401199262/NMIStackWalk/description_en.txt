This project is a Windows kernel proof of concept for detecting hidden no-module drivers with NMI-based stack walking.
It sends non-maskable interrupts to selected CPUs and performs stack backtraces inside an NMI callback to inspect suspicious execution paths.
The implementation is in C with a standard Visual Studio kernel-driver project layout.
Its primary use case is anti-rootkit and anti-cheat style detection research at kernel level.
