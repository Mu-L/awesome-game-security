This project is a curated knowledge base of anti-forensic techniques rather than an executable software package. The content is organized in a README that lists methods for data hiding, log tampering, registry and file-system artifact manipulation, and virtualization-based evasion ideas. It also references community-sourced examples from DFIR discussions to highlight real-world attacker tradecraft patterns. The primary audience is incident responders and security researchers studying how evidence can be obscured.
