Obfusheader.h is a header-only C++ obfuscation library for hardening binaries against straightforward static analysis.
It provides compile-time encryption for strings and constants, import and call hiding, control-flow mutation, and anti-decompiler oriented techniques.
The implementation targets C++14 and newer compilers and is designed to work across Windows and Unix-like environments.
It is primarily used in software protection and game security scenarios where developers want to increase reverse engineering cost.
