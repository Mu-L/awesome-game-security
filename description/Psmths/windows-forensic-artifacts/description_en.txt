This project is a structured guide to Windows forensic artifacts used in incident response and investigations. It is a documentation-heavy repository written in Markdown that categorizes artifacts across execution, account, file, network, persistence, and user activity domains. The material explains artifact locations, parsing options, and correlation strategies for building investigative timelines. It is intended for DFIR practitioners and security researchers who need a practical Windows artifact reference.
