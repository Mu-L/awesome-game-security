HPCS2 is a Counter-Strike 2 external cheat test project created for studying both cheating and anti-cheating behavior. It is built in C++ with Visual Studio and includes process memory utilities, handle hijacking helpers, and many engine offset headers for CS2 modules. The repository exposes configurable features through an INI file, including options for aim assistance, recoil control, and ESP-style rendering logic. It is primarily intended for educational game security research and reverse engineering practice.
