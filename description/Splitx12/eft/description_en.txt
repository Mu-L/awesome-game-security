This project is an internal cheat implementation targeting Escape from Tarkov.
It is written in C++ with assembly helpers and includes Unity object access, world and entity traversal, and in-game rendering utilities.
Features in the code include ESP-style visuals, extraction status display, aim-assist related targeting logic, and configurable menu controls.
It is intended for advanced cheat development research around Unity-based shooter memory structures and runtime manipulation.
