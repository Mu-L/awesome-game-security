This project is a kernel-assisted Steam overlay renderer that uses GDI drawing techniques.
The code is primarily C++ with some assembly helpers, and it focuses on rendering through an overlay path instead of implementing a full gameplay automation stack.
Its minimal example demonstrates how visual elements can be drawn in a game context through a Steam-overlay-style presentation.
It is mainly relevant for overlay research in game security tooling and cheat UI rendering experiments.
