This project is a Binary Ninja plugin for shellcode development and analysis.
It provides multi-architecture assembling and disassembling, along with conversion between inline hex, spaced hex, Python byte strings, and C-style arrays.
The tool is implemented in Python and integrates directly into the Binary Ninja workflow for rapid payload iteration.
Its main use case is reverse engineering, exploit prototyping, and shellcode-focused security research.
