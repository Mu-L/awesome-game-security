This project is an IDA Pro plugin that generates YARA signatures from selected instructions, strings, or raw bytes. It is implemented in Python and includes a built-in editor UI with syntax highlighting and customizable rule templates. It can build rules from disassembly, decompiler output, string views, and function-level hunting selections with related data references. The primary use case is malware and binary analysis workflows where analysts need to create reliable YARA rules quickly.
