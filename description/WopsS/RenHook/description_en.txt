This project is an open-source Windows hooking library for both x86 and x86-64 targets.
It is written in modern C++ and uses Zydis-based disassembly to build reliable inline hooks and trampolines.
The code emphasizes safe APIs, architecture support, and practical examples for function interception workflows.
It is useful for reverse engineering, instrumentation tooling, and game security research that requires runtime code redirection.
