This project is a Windows input simulation library that sends keyboard and mouse events through driver-backed methods. It supports multiple backends, including Logitech software paths, Razer Synapse, MouClassInputInjection, and DD virtual devices, with examples for AutoHotkey integration. The repository combines C and C++ components with AHK scripts to provide a unified initialization and send interface across drivers. It is mainly used in automation, game tooling, and anti-cheat evasion research where standard input APIs are insufficient.
