This project is an IDA Pro plugin that brings GPT-assisted workflows directly into reverse engineering sessions. It is written in Python and integrates with IDAPython, Hex-Rays, and LangChain to analyze pseudocode, inspect symbols, and apply comments or renaming suggestions. The plugin adds menu actions and shortcut-driven commands for semi-automated function-level investigation. It is designed for reverse engineers who want faster triage and interactive AI support while analyzing binaries.
