This project is an external Apex Legends cheat tutorial-style codebase with kernel-assisted memory access concepts. It is mainly written in C++ and documents components for kernel hijacking, game memory read/write, and SDK-based entity handling. The structure also includes user-mode project elements typically used for external visualization or control logic. The main use case is educational exploration of external cheat architecture and related anti-cheat detection challenges.
