This project is a lightweight real-time CPU and GPU profiler delivered as a single C library plus a browser-based viewer. It supports multithreaded instrumentation, live command and log channels, saved trace playback, and high-refresh visualization with GPU-rendered UI. The profiler works across major desktop and mobile platforms and can sample APIs including D3D11/12, OpenGL, Vulkan, CUDA, and Metal. It is intended for engine programmers and performance engineers who need low-overhead profiling in games or graphics-intensive applications.
