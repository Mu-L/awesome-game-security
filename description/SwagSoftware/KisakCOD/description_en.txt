This project is a fully buildable open-source reimplementation of the Call of Duty 4 multiplayer executable. It is written mostly in C/C++ with CMake and Visual Studio build targets and integrates legacy game dependencies such as DirectX-era middleware and Steam interfaces. The repository contains large gameplay, networking, and engine-side source modules intended for practical modification and extension. It is mainly used by mod developers, engine tinkerers, and security-minded players researching legacy exploit surfaces in classic online shooters.
