This project is a simple C++ implementation of a Cheat Engine style speed hack. It demonstrates changing perceived game timing by hooking relevant APIs with Microsoft Detours. The code is compact and focused on core hooking logic rather than a full cheat framework. It is mainly useful for learners studying time manipulation and basic user-mode game hacking techniques.
