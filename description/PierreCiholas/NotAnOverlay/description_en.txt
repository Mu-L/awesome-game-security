This project is a Windows proof of concept that renders a game view in a regular window instead of using a classic transparent always-on-top overlay. It is written in C++ with Win32 and GDI, using functions like BitBlt and StretchBlt to clone screen regions and draw continuously. The accompanying explanation focuses on anti-cheat visibility of traditional external overlays and why a less suspicious window model may help experimentation. It is aimed at game security researchers studying external ESP rendering strategies and detection tradeoffs.
