This project is a Counter-Strike 2 external DMA toolset focused on real-time memory-driven cheat features. It is written mainly in C++ and includes modules for aimbot, trigger bot, radar, bunny hop, and anti-flash behavior, plus an ImGui-based control interface. The code integrates LeechCore and VMMDLL style components, JSON offsets, and configuration utilities for reading and acting on game state externally. Its main audience is game hacking and anti-cheat researchers analyzing DMA-assisted external tooling patterns.
