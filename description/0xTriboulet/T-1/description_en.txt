This project is a C++ implementation of virtual machine detection logic derived from a machine learning model. Python scripts use scikit-learn to train and tune a decision tree classifier, then the resulting rules are translated into native C++ checks. Based on the detection outcome, the sample can execute alternate behaviors such as shellcode execution or self-removal. It is intended for research on sandbox awareness techniques and automation-assisted malware analysis concepts.
