This project is an external cheat framework for Rust that combines user-mode and kernel-mode components on Windows. It is primarily written in C++ and includes a custom kernel driver for memory read/write operations plus an external DLL module. The user-mode side integrates ImGui and DirectX rendering to provide features such as ESP, aimbot, and recoil-related assistance. It is mainly used for game cheating research and for studying anti-cheat detection surfaces around driver-assisted externals.
