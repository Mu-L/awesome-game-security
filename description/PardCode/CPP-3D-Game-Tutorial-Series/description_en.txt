This project is a C++ tutorial codebase for building a 3D game and engine from scratch. It walks through Win32 windowing, DirectX 11 graphics, input handling, entity-component patterns, and game sample integration in a staged series. The repository separates reusable engine modules from the game project and tracks learning milestones through tagged versions. It is intended for learners and developers who want hands-on understanding of low-level game engine architecture.
