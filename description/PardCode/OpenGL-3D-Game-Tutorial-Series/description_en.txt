This project is a cross-platform C++ tutorial codebase for building a 3D game and engine systems with OpenGL. It demonstrates platform-specific window setup on Windows, macOS, and Linux using Win32, Cocoa, and X11, then builds core rendering pieces such as VAO, shaders, and UBO workflows. The repository also includes foundational game subsystems like entity management and input handling as part of a step-by-step learning path. It is primarily aimed at beginners and intermediate developers learning practical game programming and graphics-engine architecture from scratch.
