This project is a C++ remake of the classic Super Mario Bros with both original-inspired and custom levels. It is built with SDL2, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer, and organized as a Visual Studio game project with art and audio assets. The code demonstrates core 2D platformer systems such as rendering, level flow, and gameplay logic in a standalone desktop implementation. The main use case is game development learning and SDL-based engine practice rather than security research.
