AntiDebugSeeker is an IDA Pro plugin that automatically detects potential anti-debugging logic in analyzed binaries.
It uses Python and PyQt5 to find suspicious Windows API usage and keyword-based anti-debug techniques from configurable rule files.
The tool highlights matches, annotates addresses, supports quick navigation to detections, and includes an in-IDE configuration editor.
It targets malware analysts and security researchers who need faster triage of anti-debug protections.
