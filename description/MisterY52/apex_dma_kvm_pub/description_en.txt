This project is an external Apex Legends cheat framework built for QEMU or KVM based memory access workflows. It combines C++ gameplay modules with Rust-based memflow components and C FFI bindings to read game memory through virtualization-focused connectors. The codebase includes ESP and aiming logic, math and prediction routines, and supporting build scripts for Linux style environments. It is primarily used for studying DMA or VM-assisted game hacking techniques and related anti-cheat detection surfaces.
