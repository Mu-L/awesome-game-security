This project is a C++ SDK generator for Unreal Engine games across UE4 and UE5 versions.
It works by injecting a DLL into the target process, locating engine structures and offsets, and emitting generated headers and SDK code for analysis and tooling.
The codebase includes configurable offset overrides, multiple build options, and guidance for integrating generated output into downstream projects.
Its primary use case is Unreal Engine reverse engineering, including game security research, modding analysis, and internal structure mapping.
