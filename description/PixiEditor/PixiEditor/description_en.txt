This project is an all-in-one open-source 2D editor for pixel art, painting, vector work, animation, and image editing. It is built mostly in C# on .NET with an Avalonia-based desktop UI and a large modular codebase. Major features include multiple toolsets on one canvas, timeline animation tools, and a node-based rendering workflow for effects and procedural edits. It is designed for artists and indie game developers who need a flexible 2D content creation tool.
