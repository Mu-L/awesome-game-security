This project is a C++ game cheat foundation that promotes a clean, modular architecture instead of monolithic feature code.
It provides structured examples with separated data providers, feature modules, runners, and shared state to keep large object-processing logic maintainable.
The repository includes sample projects, including an Unreal-focused internal example, to demonstrate extension patterns in practice.
Its main audience is developers and researchers building maintainable cheat prototypes for experimentation.
