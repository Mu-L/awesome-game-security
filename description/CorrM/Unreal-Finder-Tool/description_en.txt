This project is a utility for extracting runtime data from Unreal Engine games and generating usable SDK information.
It is written in C++ and includes features such as GNames and GObjects discovery, instance dumping, and SDK generation with an ImGui-based interface.
The codebase also includes kernel-assisted memory read and write components and configuration profiles for different engine targets.
It is mainly used in Unreal reverse engineering workflows for game analysis and tooling.
