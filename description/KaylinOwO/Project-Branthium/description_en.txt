This project is a Windows game cheating framework that combines a user-mode client with a kernel driver component. It includes modules for features such as aimbot logic, ESP visuals, entity caching, and weapon prediction, along with an ImGui and DirectX9 based menu and overlay stack. The primary implementation is in C++, with Visual Studio solution files and low-level memory interaction code in both cheat and driver directories. It is intended for game hacking experimentation and reverse engineering workflows, especially for Apex Legends style targets.
