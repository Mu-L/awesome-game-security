ps2_ida_vu_micro is an IDA Python plugin that searches for and disassembles PlayStation 2 VU microcode inside executables. It provides shortcut-driven workflows for both manual ranges and automatic discovery from VIF MPG command patterns. The implementation is lightweight and practical, with known limitations in some branch target reconstruction scenarios. Its primary use case is PS2 game reverse engineering and analysis of vector unit programs.
