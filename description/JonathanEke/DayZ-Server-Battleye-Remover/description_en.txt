This project is a C++ patch utility that modifies a DayZ server executable to disable specific anti-cheat checks. It automates binary pattern scanning and patching so updates can be reprocessed without manual hex editing. The codebase is lightweight and focused on executable manipulation logic rather than a full server framework. Its use case is reverse engineering and anti-cheat bypass experimentation in controlled test environments.
