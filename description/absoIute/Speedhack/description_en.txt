Speedhack is a lightweight Windows implementation for manipulating a program's perceived execution speed.
The project is written in C++ and can be built into a DLL for injection into target processes.
It relies on timing-related API hooking with Detours to accelerate, slow down, or pause runtime behavior.
The tool is commonly used in cheat development experiments and anti-cheat research around time tampering.
