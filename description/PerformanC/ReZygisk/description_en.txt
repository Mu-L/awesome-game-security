This project is an open-source standalone implementation of the Zygisk API stack for rooted Android environments. It is rewritten largely in C and focuses on a cleaner architecture, lighter binaries, and compatibility across Magisk, KernelSU, and APatch-based setups. The repository includes module packaging, dependency integration, and operational tooling designed for stable process injection and runtime hooks on modern Android systems. Its main audience is Android security researchers and module developers who need a transparent Zygisk-compatible runtime layer.
