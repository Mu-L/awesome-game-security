This project is a kernel anti-cheat emulation framework for studying how protected drivers behave under simulated kernel conditions.
It is written in C++ and includes components for PE mapping, import resolution, memory tracking, exception handling, and privileged-instruction emulation.
The codebase models key kernel structures and monitors read or write behavior to investigate anti-debug and anti-emulation checks.
It is aimed at anti-cheat and low-level security researchers using it as a learning and experimentation platform.
