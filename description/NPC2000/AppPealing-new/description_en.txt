This project is an Android Xposed module that disables protections provided by Inka AppSealing.
It targets root and cheat detection bypasses and can dump decrypted Dex content for inspection and debugging.
The module uses Java for Xposed integration and C++ native hooking components with Dobby in an LSPosed and Magisk workflow.
It is primarily aimed at mobile app and game security testing, reverse engineering, and anti-tamper analysis.
