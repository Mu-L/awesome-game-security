KernelMon is a virtualization-based Windows monitoring framework that traces kernel activity in a ProcMon-like workflow. It hooks selected kernel-mode APIs and forwards logs to a user-mode interface, covering file system, registry, process, and thread operations. The implementation uses a kernel driver with VMX/EPT-style low-level interception components and a companion desktop UI. It is intended for kernel security research, behavior analysis, and anti-cheat or malware investigation in controlled VM environments.
