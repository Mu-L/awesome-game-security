This project is an internal visual cheat framework for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It is written primarily in C++ and uses Source engine interfaces, hooking, netvar handling, pattern scanning, and an ImGui-based DirectX9 menu. Core modules include aim assistance, recoil handling, skin and inventory customization, event listeners, and configuration management. It is mainly intended for game hacking research and for studying internal cheat architecture on Source-based games.
