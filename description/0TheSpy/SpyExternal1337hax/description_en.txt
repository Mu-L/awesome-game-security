This project is an external cheat implementation for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive on Windows. It is built in C++ and uses Win32 and Direct3D9 components to read game state externally and render overlay features. The codebase includes memory access helpers, BSP parsing, basic obfuscation utilities, and a configurable feature system with custom resources. It is mainly a reference for researchers exploring external cheat design and overlay-based automation techniques.
