kernel_devicetree is a branch index for Xiaomi device kernel device-tree sources across multiple models and Android generations.
Its README is organized as a concise lookup table that maps branches to devices, platform tags, and release baselines.
This makes it easier to find board configuration data used in kernel bring-up, hardware tuning, and compatibility work.
It is primarily useful to Android platform engineers and researchers investigating low-level device configuration and security behavior.
