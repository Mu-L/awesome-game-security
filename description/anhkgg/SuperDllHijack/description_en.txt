This project is a generic DLL hijacking helper for Windows that simplifies proxy-DLL style interception.
It provides C/C++ code and examples to forward exports without manually recreating every original function signature.
The approach uses a renamed original module and a replacement DLL that invokes a helper routine in DllMain to pass through behavior.
It is useful for loader experimentation, red-team style research, and studying module-loading abuse in game security environments.
