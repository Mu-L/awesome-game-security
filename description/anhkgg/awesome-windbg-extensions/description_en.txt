This project is a curated list of WinDbg extensions and related debugging resources.
It catalogs tools for kernel analysis, incident response, rootkit hunting, memory inspection, and debugger workflow automation.
The repository is Markdown-focused and serves as a reference index rather than a standalone software implementation.
It is useful for reverse engineers and game security analysts who rely on WinDbg plugins for low-level Windows investigation.
