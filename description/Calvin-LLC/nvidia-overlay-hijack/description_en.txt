This project is a DirectX 11 and ImGui overlay sample that renders a custom menu through the NVIDIA in-game overlay path. It is written in C++ and includes helper drawing routines, menu animation logic, input handling, and x86/x64 support. The implementation focuses on practical overlay integration patterns rather than stealth, and it explicitly notes anti-cheat detection risk. It is mainly used for graphics-hook experimentation, overlay prototyping, and cheat UI research.
