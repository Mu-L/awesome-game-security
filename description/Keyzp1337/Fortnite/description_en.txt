This project is an internal cheat base for Fortnite with common combat and visualization features. It advertises capabilities such as ESP, aimbot, no recoil, and an ImGui-driven menu, and it expects users to integrate or provide their own injection path. The code is primarily C++ with x64-oriented project files and offset-dependent game integration points. It is aimed at cheat development practice and reverse engineering of game client internals.
