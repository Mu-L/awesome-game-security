This project is a kernel-mode C++ example that moves the mouse by applying relative movement from a Windows driver. It includes a simple WDK-style driver skeleton with version checks and per-build kernel offset handling. The implementation is intentionally limited and demonstrates low-level input manipulation rather than robust evasion. It is mainly useful for learning driver development and experimenting with game input control at kernel level.
