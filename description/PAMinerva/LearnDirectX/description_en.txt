This project is a learning resource and documentation set for building graphics applications with DirectX 12. It provides step-by-step tutorials that progress from window creation and hello-triangle examples to command bundles, frame buffering, textures, and resource state management. The material explains low-level GPU concepts such as synchronization, descriptor handling, and performance-oriented API usage on modern Windows systems. It is aimed at developers who want a practical path into Direct3D 12 and game rendering fundamentals.
