This project is a custom bootloader and tool suite for Nintendo Switch systems with a graphical front end. It is built mostly in C and low-level system code, and includes boot management for multiple environments, payload launching, and firmware patch support. The toolkit also provides maintenance features such as eMMC or emuMMC backup and restore, partition tools, and hardware diagnostics. It is intended for console modding, firmware research, and advanced Switch platform experimentation.
