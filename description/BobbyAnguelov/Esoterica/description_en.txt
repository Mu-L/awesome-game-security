Esoterica is an MIT-licensed prototype game engine framework built as a technology demonstrator and educational platform. The C++ codebase provides core engine systems such as serialization, resource management, reflection code generation, and editor tooling. It also includes advanced runtime components like an actor and ECS hybrid model, animation graph systems, and PhysX-based ragdoll support. The project is primarily aimed at engine developers and researchers experimenting with rendering, gameplay architecture, and tooling design.
