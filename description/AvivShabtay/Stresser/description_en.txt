Stresser is an endpoint security platform that combines host agents with centralized management components. The repository is primarily C++ and includes both user-mode and kernel-mode modules for telemetry collection, artifact processing, policy handling, and detection logic. Its architecture emphasizes ETW-driven monitoring, dynamic and static analysis paths, and coordinated response workflows. The project is intended for malware defense research and enterprise-style endpoint protection experiments.
