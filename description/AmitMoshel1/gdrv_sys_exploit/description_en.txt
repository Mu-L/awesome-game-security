This project is a proof-of-concept toolkit for exploiting the vulnerable gdrv.sys driver. It is implemented in C++ as a Visual Studio solution with multiple examples, including arbitrary-write and shellcode-oriented variants. The code demonstrates how exposed driver primitives can be abused for kernel-level actions on modern Windows systems. Its primary use case is educational kernel exploitation research and understanding BYOVD-style attack paths in game security and anti-cheat contexts.
