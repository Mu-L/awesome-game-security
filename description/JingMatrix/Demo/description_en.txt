This project is an Android demo application for detecting user-space library injection at runtime. It demonstrates multiple detection strategies, including soinfo linked-list checks, virtual memory map inspection, and module unload counter monitoring. The implementation combines Kotlin Android code with native C++ components built through CMake. Its primary use case is mobile anti-cheat and security research focused on identifying injection techniques.
