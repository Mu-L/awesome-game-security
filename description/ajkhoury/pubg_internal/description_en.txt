pubg_internal is an archived internal cheat research project for PUBG that combines user-mode and kernel-mode components. It includes a kernel driver for protected process mapping, a game SDK generator, and a basic internal ESP implementation. The code illustrates practical integration of memory access, game structure extraction, and in-process feature logic in C and C++. It is primarily relevant for studying historical game cheat architecture and anti-cheat threat models.
