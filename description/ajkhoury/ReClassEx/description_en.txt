ReClassEx is an extended Windows memory class reconstruction and inspection tool used during reverse engineering. It is implemented in C++ and provides an interactive interface for modeling in-memory structures while attached to a process. Key capabilities include RTTI support, PDB symbol loading, module-based address targeting, plugin extensibility, and improved navigation for large class layouts. The tool is widely applicable to game hacking and malware analysis workflows where understanding dynamic memory layouts is critical.
