This project is an LLDB integration that exposes debugger capabilities through a Model Context Protocol server.
It combines Python components for an LLDB plugin and an MCP bridge so AI assistants can drive debugging through structured tool calls.
The codebase includes commands for target creation, process control, breakpoints, backtraces, disassembly, memory reads, and expression evaluation.
It is intended for reverse-engineering and vulnerability research workflows where interactive debugging needs to be automated or assistant-assisted.
