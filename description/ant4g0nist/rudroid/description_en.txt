This project is a Rust-based educational Android ELF emulator that demonstrates core emulator construction concepts.
It implements components such as an ELF loader, memory management, syscall handling, filesystem abstractions, and ARM64 execution scaffolding with Unicorn.
The repository includes walkthrough-style documentation, architecture diagrams, and sample binaries to explain the design step by step.
It is primarily aimed at low-level systems learners and security researchers studying Android binary behavior and emulation internals.
