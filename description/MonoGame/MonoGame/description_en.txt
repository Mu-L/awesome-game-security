This project is a cross-platform .NET game framework for building 2D and 3D games. The codebase is primarily C# with supporting native components, and it provides extensive modules for graphics, audio, content processing, input, and platform abstractions. It ships with framework libraries, templates, tools, and sample assets to support desktop, mobile, and other target environments. Its main use case is production game development and engine-level experimentation in managed language workflows.
