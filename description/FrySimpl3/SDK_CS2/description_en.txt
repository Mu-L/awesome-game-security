This project is a generated CS2 SDK header pack that exposes engine types, enums, and subsystem interfaces. It is composed of C++ headers covering major engine domains such as client, rendering, networking, schema, panorama, particles, and physics. The content is organized as reference definitions that can be consumed by external tooling and research code. Its primary use case is reverse engineering support and technical groundwork for Counter-Strike 2 analysis tools.
