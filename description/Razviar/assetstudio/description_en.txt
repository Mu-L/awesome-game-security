This project is a multi-threaded Unity asset extraction tool for Unity 2.x through Unity 6.
It provides both GUI and CLI binaries, parallel bundle loading, and parallel export to speed up large-scale asset processing.
The implementation is primarily C#/.NET and includes format parsers, decompression routines, and game-specific helper logic.
It is used for game data mining, modding workflows, and reverse engineering of Unity asset bundles.
