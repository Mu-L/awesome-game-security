This project is a reference set of Counter-Strike 2 function-signature notes used to locate internal game routines.
It is organized mainly as Markdown documentation plus an IDC helper script, with separate pages for features like team switching, item giving, chat handling, and damage-related routines.
Instead of providing exact universal patterns, it documents string anchors and guidance to refine signature searches across builds.
It is useful for game reverse engineering, modding research, and maintaining offset and signature updates for security tooling.
