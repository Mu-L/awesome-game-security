This project is an automatic offset updater designed for cheat and reverse engineering toolchains. It is primarily implemented in C++ for Visual Studio and uses JSON-based offset data with network fetching components. The codebase adapts an existing updater pattern so offsets can be refreshed without rebuilding an entire loader after each game patch. Its primary use case is maintaining VALORANT-related research or automation projects that depend on current memory offsets.
