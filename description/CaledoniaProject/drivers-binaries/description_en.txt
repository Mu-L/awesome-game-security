This project is a collection of Windows kernel driver binaries gathered for vulnerable driver and BYOVD research. It mostly contains compiled .sys files from multiple vendors along with reference links to CVEs, reports, and exploitation writeups. The repository serves as a practical sample set for testing detection rules, threat hunting pipelines, and defensive controls around signed driver abuse. Its primary audience is security researchers and defenders studying kernel-level attack surfaces rather than application development.
