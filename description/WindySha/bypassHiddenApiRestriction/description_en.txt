This project is an Android library for bypassing hidden non-SDK API restrictions on Android 9 through Android 12.
It combines Java and Kotlin integration with native C and C++ components built through JNI and CMake.
The codebase provides a packaged dependency flow and a simple initialization call that can be placed in application startup.
It is mainly useful for Android reverse engineering, compatibility testing, and security research workflows that need restricted platform interfaces.
