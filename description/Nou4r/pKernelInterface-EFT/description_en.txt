pKernelInterface-EFT is an external Escape from Tarkov reversal framework with cheat-oriented functionality. It integrates kernel-assisted memory interaction, entity processing, and gameplay modules such as ESP and aiming logic. The project is heavily C++ based and includes an ImGui rendering stack for overlay output and tooling interfaces. Its main use case is practical reverse engineering and prototyping for game security research on protected titles.
