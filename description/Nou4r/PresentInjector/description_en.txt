PresentInjector is a Windows kernel-assisted DLL injection project that executes loading through graphics Present pointer swapping. It combines user-mode and kernel-mode components, including PFN-related memory handling, pointer-chain techniques, and post-injection cleanup behavior. The code is written in C/C++ and focuses on getting mapped payloads into protected game processes. Its primary use case is advanced cheat injection research and anti-cheat bypass experimentation.
