ModFinder is a Windows C++ utility designed to locate manually mapped modules in process memory. It enumerates mapped regions and checks DOS-header patterns to identify suspicious injections, including cases where parts of optional headers are removed. The implementation is native C++ with a Visual Studio project layout and practical focus on x86 process analysis. Its primary use case is anti-cheat and malware-oriented memory forensics during runtime investigations.
