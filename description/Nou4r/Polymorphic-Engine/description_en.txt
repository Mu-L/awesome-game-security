Polymorphic-Engine is a C++ runtime polymorphism and obfuscation framework for protecting in-memory variables. It supports stack and heap transformations across multiple primitive and string types, with optional SIMD type support for extended builds. The project targets LLVM/Clang most strongly and includes experimental MSVC compatibility plus example code. Its main use case is software protection experimentation and anti-analysis research in low-level security contexts.
