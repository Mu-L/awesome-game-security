gzdoom is a modder-friendly source port of the classic Doom engine with modern OpenGL and Vulkan rendering support.
The codebase is primarily C and C++, spans many engine subsystems, and is distributed under GPLv3 with active community maintenance.
It provides tooling and infrastructure for gameplay extensions, content mods, scripting, and cross-platform engine development.
Its core use case is open-source game engine and modding work, and it is relevant to researchers analyzing real-world game runtime architecture.
