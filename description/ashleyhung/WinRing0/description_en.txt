This project is a Windows C++ sample that uses the WinRing0 driver and API to read low-level CPU telemetry, especially core temperatures. It accesses CPUID and MSR data through the bundled user-mode library and kernel driver components, then logs results to a local record file. The repository includes headers, binaries, and a simple console program for per-core monitoring under administrator privileges. Its main use case is hardware monitoring and low-level Windows systems programming practice.
