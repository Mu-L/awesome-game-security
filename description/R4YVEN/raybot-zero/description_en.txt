This project is a kernel-mode CS:GO cheat that runs core logic without a traditional user-mode controller.
It combines a C++ Windows driver with a small C# loader and implements features such as triggerbot, bunnyhop, glow visuals, and kernel-level key-state reading.
The code relies on game offsets and low-level memory routines to interact with player entities and engine data.
It targets cheat development research and kernel anti-cheat evasion experimentation.
