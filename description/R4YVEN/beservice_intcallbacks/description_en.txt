This project is a proof-of-concept BattleEye bypass experiment based on instrumentation callback behavior.
It is implemented with C++, some assembly, and Visual Studio project files that focus on callback and symbol-handling techniques.
The repository appears to document an exploratory approach rather than a polished end-user tool.
Its primary use case is anti-cheat bypass research and low-level Windows internals study.
