This project is a Windows kernel-mode proof of concept focused on anti-cheat callback and integrity hook manipulation. It demonstrates techniques such as redirecting object callbacks through code caves and tampering with selected integrity-check paths. The implementation is written in C/C++ as a KMDF-style driver project targeting low-level system internals. It is mainly used for anti-cheat research, defensive testing, and understanding kernel detection and hardening strategies.
