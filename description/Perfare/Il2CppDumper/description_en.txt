This project is a reverse-engineering utility for Unity IL2CPP binaries and metadata files. It is implemented in C# and supports multiple executable formats, including ELF, Mach-O, PE, NSO, and WASM across a broad range of Unity versions. The tool can reconstruct dummy DLL metadata and generate helper outputs for IDA, Ghidra, and Binary Ninja, along with structure headers for deeper analysis. Its primary use case is Unity game reverse engineering, static analysis, and protection research.
