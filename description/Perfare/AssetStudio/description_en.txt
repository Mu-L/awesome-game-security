This project is a desktop tool for exploring, extracting, and exporting Unity assets and AssetBundles. It is primarily written in C# and supports a wide range of Unity versions and asset types, including textures, audio, fonts, meshes, shaders, and animation-related data. The tool can decompress bundles, inspect scene hierarchies, and export data into practical formats such as images, OBJ, JSON, and FBX-related outputs. It is commonly used by reverse engineers, modders, and game-security analysts who need to inspect Unity game content.
