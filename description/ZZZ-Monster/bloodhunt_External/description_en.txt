bloodhunt_External is a C++ external cheat project for Bloodhunt built as a Visual Studio solution.
It combines an ImGui and DirectX9 overlay layer with memory-access helpers, offsets, and configuration headers for runtime targeting.
The repository also includes mhyprot-related driver utility components that support low-level process interaction patterns used by external tools.
Its primary use case is game security research into external cheat architecture and anti-cheat evasion-oriented implementation details.
