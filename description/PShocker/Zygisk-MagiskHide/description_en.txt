This project is a Zygisk-based Magisk module that recreates MagiskHide-style hiding behavior. It contains native code to conceal Magisk-related mounts and modify sensitive Android system properties that root-detection checks often inspect. The build scripts package multi-ABI binaries into installable module archives for deployment on rooted devices. It targets mobile security research and anti-detection testing in environments where apps enforce root checks.
