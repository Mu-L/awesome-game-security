This project is a tutorial-oriented x64 PE packer and protector implemented in C++ with Visual Studio.
It demonstrates how executable packing workflows can wrap and protect Windows binaries at load time.
The repository includes source code and build assets that help readers study PE structures, packing stubs, and protection mechanics.
Its main audience is security learners and reverse-engineering practitioners exploring packer design.
