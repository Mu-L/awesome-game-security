This repository is a large collection of Windows kernel driver binaries gathered from many hardware vendors and software products. Instead of source code, it mainly provides categorized .sys files that can be used as a reference corpus of third-party drivers. The dataset includes drivers from system utilities, OEM tools, security software, and other applications that commonly expose kernel interfaces. It is mainly useful for vulnerable-driver research, exploit reproduction, and anti-cheat bypass or hardening studies.
