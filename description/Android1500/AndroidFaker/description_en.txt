This project is an Xposed module that spoofs Android device identifiers to mask real hardware and account metadata. It focuses on replacing values such as IMEI, Android ID, MAC-related fields, SIM identifiers, and other tracking-relevant properties. The module is designed for rooted devices with Xposed or LSPosed environments and provides randomization and manual editing options. Its main use case is privacy-oriented device identity obfuscation and testing how apps handle spoofed identifiers.
