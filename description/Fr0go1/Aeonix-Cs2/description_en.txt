This project is an external Counter-Strike 2 cheat framework built as a derivative of an earlier external base. It is implemented in C++ on Windows and includes overlay and tooling components with features like ESP, aimbot with recoil control, triggerbot, radar, and config management. The code relies on common game-hacking patterns such as memory access modules, offset handling, and real-time rendering of visual aids. Its intended use case is offensive game security experimentation and cheat development learning.
