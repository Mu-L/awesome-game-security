This project is an experimental Rust-based emulator for the World of Warcraft 3.3.5 server stack. It currently focuses on the authentication server and is designed to interoperate with TrinityCore-style database schemas. The codebase uses async Rust components, SQL-centric workflows, and containerized setup paths to support development and testing. It targets developers and protocol researchers building safe, modular, and modern infrastructure for game emulation.
