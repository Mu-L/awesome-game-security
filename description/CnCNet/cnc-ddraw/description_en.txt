This project is a replacement DirectDraw wrapper that improves compatibility for legacy 2D games on modern systems. It adds rendering backends, shader-based upscaling, windowed and borderless modes, frame limiting, and quality-of-life hotkeys. The implementation is mainly C and C++ and targets Windows as well as Wine-based environments across Linux, macOS, and Android. It is intended for retro game players and modders who need stable rendering and modern display behavior in older titles.
