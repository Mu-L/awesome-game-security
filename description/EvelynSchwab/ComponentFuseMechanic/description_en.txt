This project is an Unreal Engine 5.2 gameplay prototype that implements a fuse mechanic through an actor component.
It uses C++ and Blueprint-ready systems to pick up objects, align sockets, project placement previews, and create physics constraints with Chaos.
The implementation includes socket proximity matching, clipping checks, constrained attachment behavior, and debug visualization hooks for testing interactions.
Its primary use case is game mechanic prototyping and technical exploration of physics-driven object combination systems.
