This project is a command-line utility for removing Authenticode signatures from Windows PE files such as EXE, DLL, and SYS binaries.
It is implemented in C and provides 32-bit and 64-bit builds along with source code and Visual Studio project files.
The tool strips signature-related data and addresses PE header edge cases that can interfere with re-signing workflows.
It is mainly aimed at reverse engineering, malware analysis, and software security testing scenarios that require unsigned binary manipulation.
