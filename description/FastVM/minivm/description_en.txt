This project is a small optimizing virtual machine and runtime with JIT compilation. It is implemented in C11, integrates Cuik TB for code generation, and includes Lua-based test and benchmark programs. The build system uses GNU Make and targets multiple platforms including desktop environments and WebAssembly. It is primarily aimed at VM, compiler, and runtime performance experimentation.
