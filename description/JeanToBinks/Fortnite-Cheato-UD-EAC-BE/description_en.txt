This project is a Windows external cheat prototype for Fortnite that reads game memory and renders an on-screen overlay. It is written in C++ and includes process memory access routines, Unreal-oriented transform math, and DirectX-style drawing helpers. The code focuses on extracting player data structures and visualizing entities in real time. Its primary use case is cheat development experimentation and anti-cheat evasion research.
