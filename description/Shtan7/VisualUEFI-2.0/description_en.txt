This project provides a VisualUEFI-style development setup configured for Clang and DWARF debugging information. It combines C and C++ UEFI sample code with EDK2-related projects and Visual Studio tooling to build firmware applications. The workflow is designed for source-level debugging on Windows through VMware and remote GDB frontends such as CLion. It is useful for firmware developers and security researchers studying UEFI internals and boot-time behavior.
