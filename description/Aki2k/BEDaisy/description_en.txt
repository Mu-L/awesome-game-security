This project is a reverse engineering proof of concept focused on BattlEye's bedaisy.sys kernel anti-cheat driver. It is written in C++ and demonstrates interception techniques using image load callbacks and IAT hooking around MmGetSystemRoutineAddress. The code discusses taking control over subsequent anti-cheat execution paths and includes APC-related experimentation. It is intended for researchers studying kernel anti-cheat behavior, bypass surfaces, and defensive hardening opportunities.
