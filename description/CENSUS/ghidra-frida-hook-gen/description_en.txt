This project is a Ghidra extension that generates Frida hook scripts directly from disassembly context. It is implemented in Java and adds right-click actions for full script generation, reusable snippets, and advanced hook configuration. The plugin supports both function-level and arbitrary address hooks to speed up dynamic analysis setup. It is useful for reverse engineers and security researchers who bridge static analysis in Ghidra with runtime instrumentation in Frida.
