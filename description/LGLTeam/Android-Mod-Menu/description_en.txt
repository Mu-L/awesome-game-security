Android Mod Menu is a floating menu framework for IL2CPP and other native Android games.
It combines Java UI code with native C/C++ hooks and integrates components such as KittyMemory, MSHook, And64InlineHook, and string obfuscation utilities.
The template supports ARMv7 and ARM64 devices across a wide Android version range and embeds assets as Base64-backed native data.
It is mainly used by game modding and security researchers to prototype runtime feature toggles and hook-based experiments.
