This project is an IDA Pro plugin that improves cross-reference navigation through a dockable viewer panel. It lists function xrefs in real time, supports click-to-jump navigation, and provides hotkeys for fast movement between references. The plugin is written in Python with IDA APIs and PyQt, and adds filters for immediates, parameter counts, and binary signatures. It is intended for reverse engineering tasks such as game binary analysis and vulnerability research.
