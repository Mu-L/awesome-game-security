This project is a full source release of a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheat framework intended as a learning codebase.
It is built in C++ and includes core modules for aiming logic, visuals, configuration handling, and in-game menu integration.
The repository ships project files and supporting UI components, emphasizing that users should build and study the code rather than treat it as a ready binary.
Its main use case is educational game security research and exploration of cheat architecture in legacy Source-engine titles.
