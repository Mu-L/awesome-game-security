This project is an iOS port of Cheat Engine's ceserver for memory inspection and manipulation on mobile apps.
It supports both jailed and jailbroken workflows, with features such as memory search and editing, breakpoints, watchpoints, pointer scanning, and instruction patching.
The implementation is mainly in C and C++, with iOS-facing components and companion Windows plugins for iOS stack traces and RTTI.
Its primary use case is reverse engineering and game security research on iOS targets.
