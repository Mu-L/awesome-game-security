This project is a web-based configuration generator and editor for PalWorld settings files. It is built with JavaScript, HTML, and related front-end assets to provide a form-driven interface for changing gameplay parameters. Users can customize options like difficulty and progression rates and then immediately download a generated config file. It is mainly aimed at players and server operators who want faster, less error-prone game setup customization.
