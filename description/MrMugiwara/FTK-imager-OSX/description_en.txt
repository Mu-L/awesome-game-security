This project provides a macOS-focused package and usage guide for running a command-line forensic disk imaging tool.
It centers on acquiring drive images, splitting outputs, and verifying integrity with hash checks such as MD5 and optional SHA1.
The repository includes executable usage examples and options for E01/SMART formats, fragmentation, compression, and evidence metadata fields.
Its main audience is digital forensics practitioners and incident responders who need imaging workflows on macOS.
