This project is a collection of proof-of-concept programs for triggering known Android kernel vulnerabilities. It is primarily written in C and includes many CVE-specific samples, including cases tied to vendor drivers and Wi-Fi components. The code demonstrates low-level techniques such as crafted ioctl calls, race conditions, and driver-facing memory manipulation. It is mainly useful for kernel security researchers who want to reproduce bugs, validate mitigations, and study Android exploit primitives.
