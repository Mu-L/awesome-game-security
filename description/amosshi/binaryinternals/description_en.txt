Binary Internals Viewer is a Java application for visual, interactive inspection of binary file formats down to field and bit-level structure. It supports multiple formats including BMP, Java class files, JPEG, PNG, and ZIP, with additional format modules under development. The project is built with OpenJDK and Maven and also ships reusable standalone format libraries. It is useful for reverse-engineering education, parser development, and hands-on binary format analysis.
