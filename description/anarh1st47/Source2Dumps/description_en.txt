This repository provides dumped Source 2 engine data such as netvars, interfaces, and class IDs for multiple Valve titles. It aggregates generated headers and text listings for games including Dota 2, Artifact variants, Half-Life: Alyx, and Sandbox environments. Most content is structured reference data in C++ header and text form rather than application code. It is primarily used for Source 2 reverse engineering, offset tracking, and game security tooling workflows.
