WinKernel-Resources is a curated collection of materials for learning Windows kernel internals and exploitation concepts. It gathers references such as papers, conference talks, vulnerable-driver resources, and practical links for both offensive and defensive low-level security work. The repository also includes sample driver projects and Visual Studio solutions that demonstrate kernel-oriented development patterns. Its primary audience is security researchers, anti-cheat engineers, and developers studying kernel attack and defense techniques.
