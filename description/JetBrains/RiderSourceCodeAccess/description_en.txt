This project is an Unreal Engine plugin that integrates Rider as a selectable source code editor inside Unreal Editor. It is implemented in C++ with Unreal plugin modules and includes logic to discover Rider installations across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The plugin supports different Rider versions and configurable custom install paths. The main use case is improving C++ game development workflows for Unreal teams using the JetBrains ecosystem.
