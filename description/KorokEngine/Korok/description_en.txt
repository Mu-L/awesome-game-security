This project is a lightweight cross-platform 2D game engine with a component-based architecture.
It provides reusable modules for animation, rendering, assets, audio, and gameplay systems.
The engine is primarily written in Go and follows a compact package-oriented design inspired by modern engine architecture ideas.
Documentation and sample projects are included to help developers get started quickly.
It is intended for game developers and engine researchers who want a small open-source framework for 2D game creation.
