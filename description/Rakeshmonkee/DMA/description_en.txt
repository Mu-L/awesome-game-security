This project is a practical guide and toolkit for building and customizing PCIe DMA firmware for FPGA-based boards.
It includes step-by-step instructions for Vivado customization, automatic firmware generation scripts, config-space cloning, and flashing workflows.
The repository combines Markdown documentation with Python and Tcl utilities for project generation and firmware preparation.
Its primary use case is game security research around DMA hardware behavior and anti-cheat evasion testing in controlled environments.
