This is a compact Windows kernel driver that renders a bitmap on screen after a BSOD event. It is written in C and integrates with boot video routines through a modified BOOTVID interface. The project demonstrates low-level graphics output and crash-time display handling in kernel space with a minimal codebase. It is mainly useful for driver developers and reverse engineers exploring Windows internals and boot-time rendering behavior.
