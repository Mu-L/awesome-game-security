KPDB is a Windows kernel-mode PDB parser that resolves symbols directly in kernel environments. It is implemented in pure C and extends lightweight parsing logic to include both symbol and type stream handling. By parsing debug information at runtime, it helps avoid brittle version-specific offsets and signature scanning patterns. Its primary use case is building more stable low-level tooling for kernel reverse engineering, security research, and anti-cheat development.
