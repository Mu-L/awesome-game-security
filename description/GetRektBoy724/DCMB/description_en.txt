DCMB is a Windows kernel driver project for dynamically locating callback lists without relying on hardcoded offsets or signatures. It is written in C for the Windows driver toolchain and targets callback categories such as process, thread, image, registry, object, and minifilter notifications. The project is presented as a learning-focused implementation and exposes findings through debugging output rather than a polished product API. Its primary use case is kernel internals research related to anti-cheat, EDR, and callback inspection.
