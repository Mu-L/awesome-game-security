This project is a feature-rich, production-ready 2D and 3D game engine written in Rust with an integrated scene editor. It provides a broad engine ecosystem with editor tooling, engine crates, examples, and learning resources for full game development workflows. The architecture emphasizes Rust-native development, modular crates, and practical authoring through editor-driven iteration. Its primary use case is building and researching open-source game technology in modern Rust.
