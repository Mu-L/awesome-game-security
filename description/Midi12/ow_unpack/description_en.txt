ow_unpack is a reuploaded C++ codebase for unpacking and decrypting protected game binaries associated with Overwatch research.
The project includes multiple decryption and helper modules plus assembly-assisted routines for low-level unpacking steps.
Its structure reflects a practical reverse engineering tool rather than a polished end-user product.
The primary use case is binary analysis and unpacking study in game security contexts.
