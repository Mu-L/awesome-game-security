ThreadHijackingInjector is a minimal C++ proof-of-concept for DLL injection via thread hijacking on Windows. The project focuses on a compact implementation that illustrates context manipulation and execution redirection in a remote process. Its small code footprint makes the technique easier to study than full-featured injection frameworks. The main use case is educational reverse engineering and security research into alternative process injection methods.
