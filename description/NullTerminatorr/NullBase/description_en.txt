NullBase is a simple C++ game-hack base designed to be easy to read and extend. It provides core building blocks such as memory helpers, entity and local-player abstractions, math utilities, and world-to-screen related code. The project uses a straightforward Visual Studio layout so learners can quickly navigate and add features. Its primary use case is teaching beginners how cheat frameworks are structured and iterated.
