NullHook is a tutorial-oriented Windows game-hacking project that combines user-mode and kernel-mode components. It demonstrates memory and hook-related workflows in a split solution containing both a driver project and a userland client. The implementation is primarily C/C++ and is intended to be loaded through external manual mapping in practical setups. Its primary use case is educational research into kernel-assisted cheat development techniques.
