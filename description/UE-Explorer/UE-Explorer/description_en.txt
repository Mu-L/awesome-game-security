This project is a Windows tool for browsing and decompiling Unreal Engine package files. It provides UnrealScript decompilation, class and sound export, package dependency inspection, and modding-oriented views such as a structured hex viewer. The application is built with C# on .NET WinForms and targets legacy Unreal package workflows. It is widely used by modders and reverse engineers working with Unreal Engine 1 to 3 era games.
