This project is an Android GUI adaptation of Il2CppDumper for on-device IL2CPP dumping tasks. It is distributed primarily as APK releases with documentation, changelogs, and configuration guidance instead of a full exposed source implementation. The tool is positioned for Android 6 through Android 14 on armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a devices and follows upstream Il2CppDumper updates. It is intended for mobile game reverse engineering users who want a simplified dumping workflow on Android.
