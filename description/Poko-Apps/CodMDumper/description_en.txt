This project is a dumper package focused on extracting Call of Duty Mobile il2cpp binaries and metadata on Android devices. The repository is mostly a release-oriented distribution with usage documentation rather than full source code. It highlights support for armv7 and arm64 environments, Termux or similar terminals, and output artifacts such as dump.cs, ida.py, and IDA JSON data. It targets mobile game reverse engineering workflows and is marked as deprecated by its author.
