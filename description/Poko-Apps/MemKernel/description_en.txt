This project is an Android kernel driver setup for low-level process memory access. It contains C and C++ kernel and user components for reading and writing target memory through a custom interface. The repository includes integration guidance for compiling the driver into a kernel build and pairing it with userland tooling. It is aimed at advanced Android security and game memory researchers exploring kernel-assisted memory operations.
