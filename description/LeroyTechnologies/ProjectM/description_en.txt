On All Fronts is an Unreal Engine 5 tactical FPS and RTS prototype focused on very large-scale combined AI and player battles.
The codebase is primarily C++ with Unreal plugin content and uses the Mass Entity ECS framework to simulate tens of thousands of entities.
It includes systems and examples for AI soldier control, command workflows, and large-map gameplay architecture.
Its main audience is engine and gameplay programmers who want to study high-scale simulation patterns that can also inform multiplayer security and anti-abuse design.
