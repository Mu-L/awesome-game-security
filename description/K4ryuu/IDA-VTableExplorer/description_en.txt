This project is a C++ plugin for IDA Pro that automates C++ virtual table analysis.
It detects GCC and MSVC vtable patterns, extracts class information, and annotates virtual function indexes and offsets.
The plugin also performs RTTI-based inheritance analysis, override comparison, and hierarchy visualization.
It is built for reverse engineering workflows where understanding polymorphism and virtual dispatch is critical.
