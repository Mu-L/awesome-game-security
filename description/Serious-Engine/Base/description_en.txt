This project provides the core source code of an open-source Croteam game engine used by the classic Serious Sam generation. It is mostly written in C and C++ and includes major subsystems for rendering, world and brush editing, entities, networking, math, audio integration, and scripting support. The tree also includes Visual Studio project files and third-party media libraries such as Ogg and Vorbis for asset and sound handling. It is mainly useful for engine programmers, reverse engineers, and modders who want to study or extend legacy FPS engine internals.
