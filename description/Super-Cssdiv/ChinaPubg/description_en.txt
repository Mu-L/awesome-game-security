This project is an Android native toolkit for PUBG-related reverse engineering and external game manipulation experiments. It combines C/C++ NDK code with multiple hooking and injection components, including inline hook frameworks, ptrace-based injection utilities, and memory tooling. The codebase also integrates ImGui-based rendering and helper modules for offsets, map data, and runtime patching. It is primarily aimed at game security researchers studying mobile anti-cheat behavior, cheat architecture, and detection surfaces.
