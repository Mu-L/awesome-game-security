This project is a macro-only C header for compile-time code obfuscation, focused on Tiny C compiler workflows on Windows. It offers function-call obfuscation, control-flow mutation, string hiding, anti-debug techniques, anti-decompilation tricks, fake signature insertion, and optional virtualized math logic. The implementation is designed to be integrated directly by including a single header and toggling behavior with preprocessor flags. It is primarily used by low-level developers and security researchers exploring software protection and binary hardening techniques.
