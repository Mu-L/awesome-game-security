This project is a Windows C++ client/server toolkit for process memory interaction over named pipes. The server side exposes operations like reading and writing memory, changing protections, allocating remote memory, and querying module bases, while the client issues structured requests. Utility code inspects system handles and process access state to acquire usable handles before performing memory operations. It is primarily used for low-level game hacking research and handle-based anti-cheat evasion experiments.
