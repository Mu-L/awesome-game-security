This project is a feature-rich hex editor and binary analysis platform for reverse engineers and low-level developers.
It offers advanced editing, pattern-language-driven parsing and visualization, data inspection, diffing, hashing, integrated disassembly, and plugin extensibility.
The codebase is primarily C++ with cross-platform desktop support and numerous built-in analysis workflows.
It is widely used for firmware, file format, memory, and game binary investigation in security research contexts.
