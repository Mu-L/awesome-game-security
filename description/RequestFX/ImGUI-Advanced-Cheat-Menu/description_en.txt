This project is an ImGui-based cheat menu framework for Windows.
It provides modular components such as ESP, aim assist, recoil control, HUD modules, and hotkey-driven settings panels.
The implementation is primarily C++ and uses SFML as the backend with custom ImGui widgets and in-memory font loading.
It is mainly used as a starter template for building and organizing game cheat user interfaces.
