gan-aimbots is a research repository containing code and datasets for studying machine-learning-driven aimbots in first-person shooters.
It is mainly Python-based and includes scripts for data collection, model training, classifier evaluation, plotting, and experiment orchestration with ViZDoom scenarios.
The project reproduces experimental pipelines from an academic publication and provides shared parameters for different GAN-aimbot groups.
It is aimed at game security researchers exploring both cheat generation methods and detection strategies.
