Alternative Code Execution is a collection of Windows proof-of-concept projects for running shellcode through callback APIs instead of CreateThread.
The repository is implemented in C++ and organized as many Visual Studio samples, each demonstrating a different callback-based execution primitive.
It focuses on position-independent shellcode execution and API abuse patterns that can reduce reliance on common injection paths.
The primary use case is offensive security and game security research into user-mode evasion and detection bypass techniques.
