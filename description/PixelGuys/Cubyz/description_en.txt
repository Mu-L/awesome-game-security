This project is an open-source 3D voxel sandbox game inspired by Minecraft. It is primarily written in Zig and uses an OpenGL-based rendering pipeline with scripts for Windows and Linux builds. Core gameplay and engine features include level-of-detail rendering, true 3D chunks without fixed world height limits, and procedural crafting systems. It is intended for players and game developers interested in voxel engine design and moddable sandbox mechanics.
