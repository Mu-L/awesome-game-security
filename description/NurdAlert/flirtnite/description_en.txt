flirtnite is a C++ external Fortnite cheat framework that combines low-level memory access with real-time overlay rendering. It includes a Hyper-V based interface layer, Unreal-structure handling code, and gameplay modules such as entity processing and aiming logic. The rendering stack uses ImGui with DirectX9-style integration to display menu and ESP-style visuals. Its primary use case is advanced game security research into offensive tooling and anti-cheat evasion behavior.
