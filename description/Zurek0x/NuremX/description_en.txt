This project is a Python-based Apex Legends cheat that uses YOLOv5 computer vision models to detect enemies from screen data. It includes trained model weights, configurable runtime parameters, overlay and aiming features, and update/version control logic. The design emphasizes AI-driven detection and control instead of direct process memory hooking, with scripts for both Windows and Linux-style workflows. It is primarily aimed at machine-learning-assisted game automation and anti-cheat-aware experimentation.
