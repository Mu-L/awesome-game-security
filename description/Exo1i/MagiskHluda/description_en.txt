This project is a Magisk module that automatically launches a stealth-modified Frida server at Android boot time. It includes module scripts for Magisk-based installation and service lifecycle management, plus a small C++ utility for update metadata and server downloads. A web UI built with HTML and JavaScript provides start/stop control, status display, and custom parameter input. It targets mobile reverse engineering and security testing workflows where persistent instrumentation and reduced detection are important.
