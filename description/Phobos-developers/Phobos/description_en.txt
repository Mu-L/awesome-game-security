This project is a community engine extension that adds features and fixes to Command and Conquer Yuri's Revenge. It is a large C++ codebase built around modified YRpp components and Syringe-based injection to extend game behavior without replacing the original game executable architecture. The repository provides extensive documentation and release channels for stable, development, and nightly builds used by mod projects. Its main use case is advanced RTS mod development and engine-level behavior customization.
