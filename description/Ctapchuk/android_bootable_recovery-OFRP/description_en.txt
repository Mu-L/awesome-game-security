This project is a full Android custom recovery codebase for building OrangeFox Recovery images. It includes large-scale C/C++ system components, Android build scripts, XML resources, and Java tooling for device recovery features. The code covers recovery UI, partition management, flashing workflows, and integration with Android bootable recovery infrastructure. It is primarily intended for Android firmware developers and power users rather than direct game security research.
