This project is a security training lab of intentionally vulnerable MCP servers for hands-on attack and defense exercises. It includes scenarios such as path traversal, indirect prompt injection, eval-based code execution, typosquatting, outdated dependencies, and secret leakage. The implementations are mainly in Python and JavaScript and include per-scenario documentation plus client configuration snippets for reproducible demos. It targets security researchers and red-team practitioners who want to assess AI agent toolchain risks in controlled environments.
