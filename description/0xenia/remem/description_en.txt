This project is a header-only C++ memory manipulation library for Windows applications. It provides typed read and write helpers with pointer validation, optional exception handling, and optional logging to reduce unsafe memory access failures. It also includes pattern scanning utilities and wrappers for calling functions with common calling conventions. It is useful for reverse engineering tools, game memory research, and other low-level debugging tasks.
