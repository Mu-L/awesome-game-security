This project is a security research proof of concept for bypassing AMSI and ETW with minimal byte patches. It includes C, PowerShell, and C# examples that illustrate where to patch branch logic in AMSI paths and how to short-circuit telemetry-related tracing calls. Diagrams and notes explain control flow and why single-byte changes can reduce the footprint of the modification. The main use case is red-team simulation and defensive validation of detection coverage around in-memory tampering techniques.
