This project is a Cheat Engine helper toolkit for inspecting and manipulating Mono-based games more efficiently. It is built mainly with Lua scripts and Cheat Engine table assets, adding searchable views for classes, fields, and methods. The tool can generate method hook templates, jump to disassembly, and create reusable table scripts for runtime monitoring. It targets reverse engineering and game security research workflows where fast Mono introspection is needed.
