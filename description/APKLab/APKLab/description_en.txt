This project is a VS Code extension that turns Android APK reverse engineering into an integrated IDE workflow. It is built with TypeScript and wraps tools such as Apktool, JADX, signing utilities, and HTTPS patching helpers behind editor commands. It supports decode, disassembly, decompilation, rebuild, signing, install, and dependency bootstrap flows on major desktop platforms. The primary audience is mobile security researchers, malware analysts, and app tampering testers.
