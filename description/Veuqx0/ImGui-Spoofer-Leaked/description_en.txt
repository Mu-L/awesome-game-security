This project is a leaked Windows hardware identity spoofer with a graphical interface built on ImGui. It is implemented primarily in C++ and bundles loader and mapper components for kernel level interaction alongside WinAPI based system routines. The code also includes anti-analysis behavior such as debugger and process checks, indicating it was designed for adversarial environments. Its primary use case is understanding how ban evasion style spoofer tooling is structured in game cheating ecosystems.
