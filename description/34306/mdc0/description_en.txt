This project is a custom iOS application for jailed devices that applies system UI tweaks without a traditional jailbreak.
It is written in Swift and targets iOS 15.0 through 18.3.2, using an exploit path to modify normally read-only system files.
The app includes changes such as dock and blur adjustments, lockscreen UI tweaks, and other cosmetic or behavior-level modifications that often require a respring helper app.
Its main use case is iOS customization and exploit-oriented research on modern non-jailbroken devices.
