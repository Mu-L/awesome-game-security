Speed Hack by Letomaniy is a Windows C++ DLL project that manipulates in-game time speed after injection into a target process.
It follows a Cheat Engine style approach and is built with Visual Studio, including Detours-based hooking components.
The sample exposes keyboard controls for slowdown, accelerated speed, and restoring normal speed, with configurable values in code.
It is mainly used for cheat development practice and for researching how games and anti-cheat systems handle time manipulation.
