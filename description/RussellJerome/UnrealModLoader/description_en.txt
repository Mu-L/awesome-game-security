This project is a mod loading framework for Unreal Engine 4 games that supports Blueprint and basic SDK-based C++ mods. It combines native hooking and event callback systems with third-party components such as MinHook and ImGui to provide lifecycle hooks and in-game tooling interfaces. The codebase includes injector and proxy DLL loading paths to bootstrap mod modules into target processes. It is primarily used by UE4 mod developers and researchers studying runtime extension and game instrumentation techniques.
