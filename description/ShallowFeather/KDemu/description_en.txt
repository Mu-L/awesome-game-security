This project is a hybrid Windows kernel driver emulator that combines emulated and native execution paths for difficult analysis targets. It is largely C++ code and includes components for PE loading, exception handling, kernel dump integration, anti-detection logic, and execution monitoring. The architecture is designed to improve visibility into rootkit and anti-cheat style drivers that resist conventional debugging environments. It is aimed at advanced malware, anti-cheat, and low-level reverse engineering research.
