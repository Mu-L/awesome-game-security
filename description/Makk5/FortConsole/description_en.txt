This project is a DLL that re-enables an Unreal Engine in-game console interface in a specific Fortnite build context.
It is written in C++ for x64 Windows and uses pattern scanning and engine object construction logic to locate and initialize console-related structures at runtime.
The repository includes low-level Unreal object enums and memory helpers to support internal injection workflows.
Its primary use case is Unreal Engine internals exploration and game security research in controlled, anti-cheat-disabled environments.
