km-um-communication is a learning-focused collection of Windows kernel-mode and user-mode communication examples. The repository gathers multiple C and C++ implementations that demonstrate different IPC and synchronization strategies between drivers and user processes. It emphasizes practical patterns such as request dispatching, event coordination, and controlled cross-boundary data exchange in test projects. The project is mainly intended for reverse engineering and game security research where understanding kernel-user interaction is essential.
