This project is an x64dbg plugin that helps analysts debug executables protected by Themida on 64-bit Windows systems. It uses C++ hooking with MinHook and works alongside common debugger tooling to neutralize anti-debug, anti-VM, and monitoring checks. The plugin focuses on practical attach-and-debug workflows instead of full unpacking automation. Its primary use case is reverse engineering protected software in research and malware analysis contexts.
