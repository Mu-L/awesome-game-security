This project is an outdated internal cheat framework for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone.
It implements common modules including ESP, bone rendering, customizable aimbot controls, recoil reduction, and miscellaneous options such as FOV and UAV settings.
The implementation is C++ based and uses an ImGui menu for in-game configuration.
It is mainly a reference for studying internal cheat architecture and feature integration in FPS titles.
