This project is an educational Windows kernel exploit targeting a vulnerable signed driver that exposes physical memory read and write primitives.
The proof-of-concept demonstrates virtual-to-physical translation techniques to convert those primitives into effective virtual memory access.
Its C++ implementation documents modern Windows offset considerations and shows a token-theft style privilege-escalation path.
It is intended for kernel security research, vulnerable driver analysis, and exploitation training.
