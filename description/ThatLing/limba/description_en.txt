This project is a proof-of-concept for compile-time control-flow obfuscation using mixed boolean-arithmetic transformations.
It generates boilerplate that hides real call targets by encoding jump addresses with randomized rewrite rules and offsets per build.
The implementation is C++20-focused and favors Clang/clang-cl toolchains, with premake-based examples for integration.
It is intended for reverse-engineering resistance research and binary obfuscation experimentation.
