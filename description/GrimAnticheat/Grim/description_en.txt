GrimAC is an open-source Minecraft anticheat designed for modern server versions and protocol combinations. It is primarily built with Java and Kotlin and implements detailed movement simulation, world replication, and latency-aware validation logic. The architecture is heavily asynchronous and multithreaded to scale checks while reducing false positives across complex gameplay edge cases. Its primary use case is server-side cheat detection for Minecraft communities that need accurate and actively maintained protection.
