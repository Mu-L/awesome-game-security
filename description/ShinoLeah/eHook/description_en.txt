This project is a framework for building Android ARM64 uprobe hooks with eBPF modules. It uses Go for orchestration and C for eBPF hook logic, with wrappers for reading and writing memory, logging, and submitting custom event data. Users configure target package and library offsets, then implement on-enter and on-leave handlers for instrumentation or behavior modification. It is mainly aimed at rooted-device dynamic analysis, mobile game research, and lightweight runtime tracing.
