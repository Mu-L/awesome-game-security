This project is an early experimental codebase for learning dynamic recompilation concepts on x86. The implementation is in C++ and uses the Zydis disassembly library to decode instruction streams, print mnemonics, and inspect operand details. It includes a small build setup with Makefiles and a Dockerfile, plus helper tables for register-name mapping. The main use case is educational reverse-engineering practice for people studying instruction decoding and binary translation pipelines.
