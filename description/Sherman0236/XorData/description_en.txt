This project is a C++ framework for compile-time and runtime-style obfuscation of constants, variables, and strings. It focuses on XOR-based data transformations that make static inspection of embedded values harder in compiled binaries. The repository includes example outputs and helper structures to integrate obfuscation patterns into normal application code. Its primary use case is software hardening experiments and anti-analysis techniques in security-sensitive code.
