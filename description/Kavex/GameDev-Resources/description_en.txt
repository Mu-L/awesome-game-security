This project is a curated index of game development resources across art, code, engines, tooling, design, and monetization topics. It organizes links into structured sections and labels items by availability, including paid, limited free, free, and open source options. The repository is maintained primarily as Markdown documentation, with a focus on discoverability rather than executable code. It serves developers and technical researchers who need a broad reference library for building or analyzing game technology stacks.
