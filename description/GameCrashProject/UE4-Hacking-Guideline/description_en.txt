UE4-Hacking-Guideline is a research-oriented documentation project that outlines a methodology for analyzing Unreal Engine 4 security weaknesses. The repository is organized as Markdown chapters covering engine background, attack vectors, tooling, build setup, and analysis process. It focuses on systematic vulnerability study at the engine level instead of only operational cheat detection topics. Its primary audience is students and security researchers learning structured game engine security assessment.
