This project is an Arduino-based automation bot for Escape from Tarkov training routines. It uses HID-capable boards to emulate keyboard and mouse input so repetitive movement cycles can be executed automatically in-game. The repository includes multiple .ino sketches plus a Python coordinate conversion helper for adapting button positions and flow updates. It is mainly targeted at hardware-assisted game automation experiments and skill-grinding scripts.
