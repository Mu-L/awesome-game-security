This project is a curated list of free and open resources for game development. The repository is maintained in Markdown and organizes tools, engines, libraries, learning material, and assets across many languages and domains. It emphasizes openly licensed software and content, with additional notes on non-free options. The main use case is helping developers and researchers quickly discover game-development tooling references.
