This project is a Windows kernel hooking implementation that modernizes InfinityHook compatibility across Windows 7 through newer Windows 11 builds. It is written in C/C++ for Visual Studio and focuses on maintaining reliable hook behavior across version-specific kernel offset changes. The source emphasizes low-level internals and includes extensive comments for understanding the implementation details. It is mainly used by kernel security researchers and anti-cheat or EDR reverse engineering practitioners.
