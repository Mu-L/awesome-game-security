This project is an external Counter-Strike: Global Offensive cheat framework implemented in C++.
It uses an ImGui-based interface and a DirectX 9 rendering backend to provide configurable modules for aim assistance, visual overlays, and gameplay automation.
Included functionality covers adjustable aim smoothing and FOV, glow effects, bunnyhop, and no-flash style helpers driven by runtime settings.
Its primary use case is educational game-hacking research and experimentation with external tooling architectures.
