This project is a DLL-based bypass targeting a game-side GPU hardware check. It is built as a C++ Visual Studio project and is intended to be injected shortly after the game launches to patch or alter runtime validation behavior. The repository focuses on a narrow bypass workflow rather than a full framework, with straightforward build-and-inject usage. Its primary audience is reverse engineers studying client integrity checks and anti-cheat related hardware gating.
