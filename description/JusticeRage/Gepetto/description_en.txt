This project is a Python plugin for IDA Pro that uses large language models to explain decompiled functions.
It can also suggest variable renaming and code comments directly from IDA through menu actions and hotkeys.
The plugin supports multiple model providers through configuration, including cloud and local API backends.
It is intended for reverse engineers who want faster code comprehension in malware, software, and game security analysis.
