GhidraBoy is an experimental extension that adds Nintendo Game Boy reverse engineering support to Ghidra. It uses Kotlin and Java code together with custom Sleigh language definitions for the Sharp SM83 CPU. The extension includes ROM loading support for banked and unbanked cartridges, boot ROM variants, memory map blocks, and hardware register symbols. Its primary use case is retro game binary analysis and low-level firmware research.
