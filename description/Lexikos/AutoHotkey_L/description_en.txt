AutoHotkey is an open-source Windows automation and macro scripting platform with a custom hotkey-focused language.
The repository is mostly C and C++ source code for building interpreter binaries, self-contained script runtimes, and related tooling.
It also includes an experimental DLL hosting interface for embedding the interpreter in other applications.
Its primary use case is task automation and input scripting, including game-adjacent macro experimentation and defensive analysis of script-driven behavior.
