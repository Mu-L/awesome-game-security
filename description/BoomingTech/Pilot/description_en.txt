The repository contains engine and editor modules with CMake-based builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes rendering, resource, scripting, and tooling infrastructure intended to demonstrate practical engine architecture in a teaching context. The project is mainly used by students and developers learning game engine implementation and graphics system design.
