This project is a Rust library for Linux anti-analysis and anti-debugging experiments.
It implements direct syscalls without libc dependencies and adds syscall-level obfuscation to make static analysis harder.
It also performs chained and randomized ptrace-based checks that validate expected behavior and terminate execution when tampering is detected.
Its main use case is security research on hardening binaries against reverse engineering in Linux environments.
