This project is an official IDA Pro integration for a cloud malware intelligence and code search workflow. It is written in Python and provides code similarity searches for bytes, strings, and functions directly from disassembly views. It also includes a notebook style panel for AI generated function summaries, editable notes, and exportable collaboration artifacts. The primary use case is accelerating reverse engineering triage for malware and other unknown binaries.
