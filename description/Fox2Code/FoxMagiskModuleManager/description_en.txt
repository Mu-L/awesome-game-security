This project is an Android application for discovering, downloading, installing, and managing Magisk modules from online repositories. It is built with Android tooling and Kotlin-based app code, with features such as repository search, module update checks, custom repo support, and separate local versus remote module views. The app also supports richer module metadata and compatibility handling for module developers and power users. Its main use case is rooted Android module management and mobile security customization workflows.
