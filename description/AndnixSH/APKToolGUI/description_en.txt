This project provides a Windows GUI wrapper around Android reverse-engineering utilities such as apktool, signapk, zipalign, and baksmali. Built in C# on .NET Framework, it streamlines decompile, rebuild, signing, alignment, and framework management workflows for APK-like packages. It also supports drag-and-drop operations, ADB helpers, multilingual UI, and automation for repetitive packaging tasks. The tool is intended for Android app analysis and legitimate modification workflows rather than anti-protection bypassing.
