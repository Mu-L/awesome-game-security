This project is a Windows kernel driver-hiding proof of concept for x64 systems. It uses ETW-related symbol discovery to locate MiProcessLoaderEntry and removes DriverObject->DriverSection in a PatchGuard-aware way. The code also erases driver-identifying artifacts after load by running cleanup logic in a separate thread. Its primary use case is anti-cheat evasion research and low-level study of driver forensic footprints.
