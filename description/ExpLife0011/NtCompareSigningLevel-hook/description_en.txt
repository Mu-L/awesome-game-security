This project is a kernel and user-mode proof of concept that swaps a function pointer inside NtCompareSigningLevels to build covert driver communication. It is implemented in C and C++ as a paired Windows driver and userland controller. The repository explicitly marks the approach as abandoned because PatchGuard makes it unstable for practical use. It is most useful as historical anti-cheat bypass research on signing-level hook surfaces and their limitations.
