This project is a Windows kernel demo that invokes user-mode routines through KeUserModeCallback. The driver creates a device interface, receives IOCTL requests, and prepares callback arguments and shellcode stubs for both 32-bit and 64-bit paths. It walks process structures such as the PEB and module export tables to resolve user32 and MessageBoxA before dispatching the callback. It is mainly for kernel-to-user transition research and understanding callback-based code execution primitives.
