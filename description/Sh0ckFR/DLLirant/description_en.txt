This archive is a lightweight placeholder that only contains a license file and a short notice pointing to a newer maintained location. No implementation source code is included in this snapshot, so there are no technical features to analyze directly. The content suggests it is kept for historical continuity rather than active development. It is mainly useful as a reference marker when tracking older tooling links in game security collections.
