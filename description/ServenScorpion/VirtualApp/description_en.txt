This project is an Android application virtualization framework for running and managing cloned apps in an isolated container. It is primarily written in Java with Android XML resources, plus native C and C++ components for low-level hooks and runtime interception. The codebase integrates Xposed compatibility and SandHook-based instrumentation modules, along with virtual package, process, and component management. It is aimed at mobile reverse engineering, app behavior analysis, and multi-instance sandbox use cases.
