This project is a DMA-assisted Apex Legends aimbot and glow test implementation built around a KVM-based memory reader.
It combines C and C++ components to read game state externally from a Linux host while controlling behavior in a guest environment.
The feature set includes recoil randomization, non-linear smoothing, target-bone randomization, and team-aware glow rendering.
It is intended for experimental game cheating research on DMA workflows and detection-surface reduction strategies.
