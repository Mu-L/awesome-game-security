This project is a VMProtect devirtualizer that lifts virtualized code into analyzable LLVM-oriented output. It uses Triton for emulation and symbolic execution, identifies VM handlers through AST pattern matching, and reconstructs control-flow structure from virtual execution. The toolchain includes custom optimization passes and workflows around intrinsics and virtual entry-point analysis. It is intended for reverse engineering research on protected binaries, including anti-cheat and software protection studies.
