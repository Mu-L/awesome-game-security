This project is an open-source Python deobfuscation and analysis framework with both GUI and CLI interfaces. It supports multiple Python obfuscators and includes analyzers for packed artifacts, hash and string inspection, behavior monitoring, and process-integrated code execution. The core is written in Python with a PySide6 interface, plus native helper components for injection and hook-assisted tooling on Windows. It is designed for malware analysts and reverse engineers who need practical Python unpacking and inspection workflows.
