This project is an improved open-source version of the X-Ray engine used by the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. It focuses on compatibility with original game content while introducing 64-bit support, performance optimizations, bug fixes, and features for mod creators. The engine is written mainly in C++ and targets multiple desktop platforms, including Linux and macOS in addition to Windows. It is used by the modding and reverse engineering community to study and extend production game engine internals.
