Amber is a reflective PE loader and payload generator for in-memory execution of native Windows binaries. The project combines Go tooling with low-level assembly loader components to map and run EXE, DLL, or SYS payloads without standard disk-based loading. It includes features such as payload encoding, API resolution obfuscation, staged delivery options, and memory cleanup behavior aimed at reducing scanner visibility. It is primarily used in offensive security research and defense testing where understanding reflective loading and evasion techniques is important.
