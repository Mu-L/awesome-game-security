Florida is an automation project that patches upstream Frida and builds an anti-detection variant of frida-server for Android.
It contains patch sets that modify recognizable Frida strings, symbols, and artifact naming to reduce straightforward detection signatures.
The repository focuses on scripted patch application and reproducible build workflows around Frida core components.
Its main use case is mobile reverse-engineering research where analysts test anti-instrumentation and anti-detection techniques.
