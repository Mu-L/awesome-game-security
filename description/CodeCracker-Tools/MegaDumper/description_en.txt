This project is a Windows .NET application for dumping native and managed assemblies from running processes. Beyond basic dumping, it includes utilities for module inspection, anti-dump and hook detection, virtual memory viewing, heap and process exploration, and AppDomain enumeration. The tool is implemented in C# WinForms and contains managed injection and minidump generation components for reverse engineering workflows. It is primarily used by malware analysts and software reversers who need to recover in-memory binaries and inspect process internals.
