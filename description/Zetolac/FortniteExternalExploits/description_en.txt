This project is a small collection of external Fortnite exploit code snippets. It uses C++ examples that demonstrate direct memory writes for behaviors such as position manipulation and simple spin-style logic. The repository is minimal and focuses on raw proof-of-concept fragments rather than a complete framework. It is primarily aimed at quick cheat experimentation and learning external memory manipulation patterns.
