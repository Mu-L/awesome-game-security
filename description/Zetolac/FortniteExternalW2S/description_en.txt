This project is a C++ proof of concept for external world-to-screen calculations in Fortnite. It includes code to read and decrypt camera/viewpoint data from process memory and convert 3D world positions into 2D screen coordinates. The implementation demonstrates matrix construction, axis transformation, and perspective projection math used by ESP overlays. It is mainly useful as a foundation for external visualization tooling in game hacking research.
