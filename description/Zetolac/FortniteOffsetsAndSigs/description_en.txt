This project is a compact Fortnite offsets and signatures reference with supporting C++ snippets. It contains example pattern-scanning code, offset notes for key globals, and helper logic for address derivation and string decryption workflows. The focus is on fast offset maintenance and signature-based relocation after game updates. It is intended for reverse engineers and cheat developers maintaining external or internal tooling.
