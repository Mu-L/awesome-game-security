This project is a desktop utility for automating a UE4SS-based starter mod setup for Palworld.
It provides a PyQt GUI to download patch files, apply or revert modifications, and manage mod enable or disable states.
The repository mixes Python application code with Lua mod scripts that adjust gameplay settings such as stamina costs, map visibility, and progression values.
It is intended for modding convenience and experimentation with Unreal Engine game behavior.
