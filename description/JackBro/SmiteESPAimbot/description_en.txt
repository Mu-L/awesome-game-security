This project is an internal C++ ESP and aimbot implementation for the game Smite.
It includes a reverse-engineered SDK header set, hook helpers, and utility code for interacting with Unreal Engine 3 era game structures.
The sample features demonstrate target acquisition and on-screen ESP drawing while documenting game-specific pointer quirks.
It is mainly aimed at game hacking learners who want a reference base for older UE3 titles.
