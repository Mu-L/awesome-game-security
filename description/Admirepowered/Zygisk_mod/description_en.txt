This project is a standalone implementation of the Zygisk runtime interface for rooted Android environments. It targets compatibility across KernelSU, Apatch, and Magisk setups, offering an alternative module-loading path when built-in or closed implementations are unavailable. The codebase uses Android build tooling with Kotlin and native components to provide API-level behavior expected by Zygisk modules. It is mainly used by Android security and modding researchers who need flexible process injection and module experimentation on rooted devices.
