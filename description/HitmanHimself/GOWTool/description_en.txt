This project is a Windows utility for extracting and converting assets from God of War (2018).
It is primarily written in C++ and built with Visual Studio, with dependencies such as DirectXTex and glTF components.
The tool extends earlier community workflows with a broader feature set and a more practical extraction pipeline.
Its main audience is game asset researchers, modders, and developers studying proprietary content formats.
