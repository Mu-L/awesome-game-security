Rust-Auto-Weapon-Detection-OpenCV-Example is a sample project that demonstrates automatic weapon detection for Rust using OpenCV.
It is written in C++ and includes Visual Studio project files, image assets, and code for color filtering and weapon index mapping.
The implementation shows a basic computer-vision pipeline for screen-based state recognition rather than direct game memory manipulation.
Its primary use case is educational experimentation with CV-assisted game automation and telemetry tooling.
