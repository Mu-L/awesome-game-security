Anti-Debugger-Protector-Loader is a Windows C++ anti-debugging and protection example project.
It continuously scans for debugger executables, window titles, and related drivers, and includes multiple debugger-detection checks with optional automatic termination behavior.
The implementation includes configurable scan intervals and optional protection actions, along with VMProtect SDK integration artifacts.
Its main audience is software protection and game security researchers studying practical anti-debugging patterns.
