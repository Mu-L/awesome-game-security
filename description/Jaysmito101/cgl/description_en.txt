This project is a single-header C graphics and utility library designed for prototyping, demo scenes, and small games. It provides cross-platform modules for windowing, rendering utilities, noise generation, math helpers, data structures, networking, and threading. The repository also includes wrappers and examples in Rust and Python, plus optional systems like bloom, audio, and node editing. It is intended for developers who want a lightweight C/C++ toolkit for rapid graphics experimentation.
