This project is a proof-of-concept Windows kernel-to-usermode communication mechanism based on swapping a kernel .data pointer. It is written in C++ with separate kernel driver and usermode components, and includes pattern scanning plus helper routines for memory operations and process base lookup. The approach emphasizes high-speed message and read-write style communication but carries stability risks on protected systems. It is intended for kernel research and anti-cheat related experimentation rather than production deployment.
