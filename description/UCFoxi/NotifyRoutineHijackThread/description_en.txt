This project demonstrates a kernel-mode notify routine hijacking method using a dedicated thread approach. It is a compact Visual Studio C++ proof of concept focused on low-level callback manipulation. The repository provides a minimal driver sample and a short showcase for understanding the technique flow. It is mainly intended for Windows kernel internals study and anti-cheat or EDR evasion research.
