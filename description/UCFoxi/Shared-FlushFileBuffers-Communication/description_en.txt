This project presents a kernel-to-user communication method based on shared buffers and FlushFileBuffers-triggered IRP handling. It demonstrates hooking IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS to process commands without relying on a persistent worker thread. The code is split into C++ kernel and user-mode components built with Visual Studio. It is useful for researching stealthier driver communication patterns in game security and anti-cheat bypass experiments.
