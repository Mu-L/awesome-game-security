This project is a C++ memory manipulation toolkit for Android processes on rooted devices. It provides process memory search, read and write operations, offset scanning, result management, and value freeze controls through a reusable class interface. The implementation works directly with process mappings and memory files to automate common cheat-engine style workflows. It is intended for game memory research, debugging, and experimentation in controlled Android environments.
