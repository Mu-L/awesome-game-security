This project is a C++ research collection for extracting data from files that are locked by other running processes.
It demonstrates several techniques, including stealing memory-mapped section handles, duplicating and closing remote handles, and related lock-bypass workflows.
The examples target scenarios like reading browser databases without stopping the browser, highlighting low-noise file acquisition behavior.
Its primary use case is authorized security research and forensics focused on understanding file-lock evasion and info-stealer tradecraft.
