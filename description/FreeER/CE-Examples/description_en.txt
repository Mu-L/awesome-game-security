This project is a broad collection of Cheat Engine examples, practice tables, scripts, and reference notes. It contains many Lua and CT assets covering memory scanning, Auto Assembler usage, pointer utilities, UI helpers, Mono-related workflows, and trainer-oriented experiments. The repository also includes focused snippets and templates that demonstrate practical reverse engineering and game memory manipulation techniques. Its core use case is teaching and accelerating Cheat Engine-based game hacking workflows.
