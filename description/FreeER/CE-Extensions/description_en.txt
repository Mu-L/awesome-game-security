This project is a set of Lua-based Cheat Engine extensions that add utility features to the CE interface and scripting environment. It includes modular tools for autosave controls, disassembler highlighting, structure and offset helpers, process attachment conveniences, and workflow quality-of-life improvements. The scripts are designed to be loaded independently and adapted to different user setups. The main audience is advanced Cheat Engine users who customize their reverse engineering and game analysis workflow.
