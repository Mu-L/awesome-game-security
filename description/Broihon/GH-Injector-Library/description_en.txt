This project is a feature-rich Windows DLL injection library for x86, x64, and WOW64 targets. It is written in C++ and implements multiple loading strategies, including several Ldr-based paths and manual mapping. The library also includes many shellcode execution methods such as NtCreateThreadEx, APC, thread hijacking, SetWindowsHookEx, and kernel callback techniques. Additional components for cloaking, hook handling, and .NET assembly loading make it useful for advanced game-hacking workflows and anti-cheat behavior research.
