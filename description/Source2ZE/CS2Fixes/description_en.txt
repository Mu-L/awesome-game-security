This project is a C++ Metamod plugin that adds gameplay fixes and server-side features for Counter-Strike 2, with a strong focus on zombie escape communities. It includes hook-driven server logic, configuration systems, admin tooling, and bundled particle or sound assets used by the plugin. The codebase also acts as a practical reference for Source 2 mod developers who need common integration and boilerplate patterns. Its primary use case is running and extending community CS2 servers with stable, configurable functionality.
