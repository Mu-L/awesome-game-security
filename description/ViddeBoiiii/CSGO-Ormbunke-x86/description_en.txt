This project is a simple internal cheat base for CS:GO with an ImGui menu targeting x86 builds. The implementation is mostly C/C++ and integrates DirectX9 rendering, Kiero hooks, and MinHook-based interception. Included features cover common cheat functions such as ESP, aimbot logic, movement assists, and trigger behavior. It is mainly intended as an educational starter for game hacking experiments and menu framework customization.
