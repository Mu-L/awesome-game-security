This project is an internal C++ cheat base for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
It includes common features such as ESP, bunnyhop, engine prediction, autowall, and chams, along with hook points like CreateMove and Direct3D reset.
The codebase uses ImGui and MinHook and is structured around interfaces, netvars, rendering, and utility modules for extension.
It is mainly intended for cheat development practice and reverse engineering research on Source-engine titles.
