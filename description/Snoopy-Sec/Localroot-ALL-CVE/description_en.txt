This repository is a large historical collection of local privilege escalation proof-of-concept exploits organized by year and CVE. It contains mostly C exploit code along with shell and Python scripts, plus per-vulnerability notes and references. The layout makes it practical to browse kernel-era exploit samples and recreate older research scenarios in controlled lab environments. Its primary use case is security education, exploit development study, and vulnerability timeline reference.
