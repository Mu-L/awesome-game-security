Drv_Hide_And_Camouflage is a Windows kernel research project focused on driver hiding and identity camouflage. It demonstrates loading and masking an unsigned driver by using many unexported kernel routines, manual offset initialization, and low-level object or import-table manipulation. The implementation is mainly in C for ring-0 driver development and includes tests across modern Windows versions. It is intended for advanced kernel security and anti-detection research scenarios.
