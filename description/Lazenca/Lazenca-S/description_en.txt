Lazenca S is an Android anti-cheating engine designed to detect common game tampering behaviors.
The project combines Java Android components with native C/C++ shared libraries loaded through JNI.
Its exported checks cover debugging, rooting, speed-hack behavior, binary modification, and virtual-machine related indicators.
It is intended for mobile game protection experiments and for studying anti-cheat detection techniques on Android.
