This project is a lightweight 3D mathematics library for games and graphics programming. It provides core math primitives and operations used in real-time engines, including vectors, matrices, and transformation helpers, with examples and tests for integration. The library is written primarily in C, with build support through CMake and additional bindings or companion code in other languages. It targets game developers and engine/tool authors who need a portable math foundation for rendering, simulation, or security research tooling.
