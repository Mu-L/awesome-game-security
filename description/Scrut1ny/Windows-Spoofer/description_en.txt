This project is an open-source Windows 10 and 11 spoofing and cleanup toolkit. It combines Batch and PowerShell modules to change selected system identifiers, adjust network-related values, and clear common trace artifacts. The workflow integrates external utilities for tasks such as volume ID and SMBIOS-related modification, with extensive notes on platform support and operational limits. It targets game security and anti-cheat research scenarios where analysts need to study hardware and software fingerprinting behavior in controlled test environments.
