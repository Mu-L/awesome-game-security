This project is an automation toolkit for setting up Linux virtualization environments with anti-detection oriented patches. It is driven mainly by Bash scripts and organizes setup modules for QEMU, EDK2, kernel patching, VFIO passthrough, and deployment helpers. The repository also includes maintained patch sets and auxiliary scripts for host and guest identifier handling. It is primarily used by researchers building reproducible VM labs for anti-cheat behavior testing and virtualization security experiments.
