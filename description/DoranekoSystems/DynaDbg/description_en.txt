This project is a remote reverse engineering and dynamic analysis suite named DynaDbg. It combines a TypeScript/React Tauri client with Rust and C/C++ backend components to provide cross-platform debugger and scanner capabilities. Key features include memory scanning modes, watchpoints, code tracing, debugger views, and host-remote workflows across multiple operating systems and architectures. It is mainly built for reverse engineering practitioners who need GUI-driven low-level analysis for software and game security research.
