This project shares a custom implementation of IoCreateDriver behavior for Windows kernel experimentation.
It highlights techniques intended to avoid standard driver load visibility paths, including bypassing common logging points.
The code is written in C/C++ for Visual Studio and WDK workflows, with notes for manual mapping setups and entry-point adjustments.
It is primarily aimed at low-level Windows internals and anti-cheat evasion research.
