This project is a modern C++ 3D game engine intended for education and general-purpose real-time development. It provides a large OpenGL-based rendering stack with PBR, screen-space effects, shadows, particle systems, and an editor workflow with runtime shader and code iteration. The engine also integrates ECS-style architecture, physics, audio, asset import pipelines, and serialization tools for full scene authoring. It is aimed at engine programmers and game developers who want a source-available framework to study or build desktop 3D applications.
