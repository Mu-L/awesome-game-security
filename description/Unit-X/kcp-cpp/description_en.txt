This project is a lightweight C++ wrapper around the KCP reliable UDP protocol. It provides client and server abstractions, callback-driven data handling, and configurable transport parameters for low-latency networking. The library targets C++17 and CMake-based builds across common desktop platforms. It is suitable for game networking prototypes and reliability-layer experimentation in real-time applications.
