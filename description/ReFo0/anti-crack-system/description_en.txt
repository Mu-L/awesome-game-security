This project is a Windows anti-tamper and anti-crack framework prototype written in C++.
It includes anti-debugging, anti-dump, anti-attach protections, integrity checks, process-kill routines, and self-remapping code paths.
It also contains string obfuscation and lightweight encryption helpers for hardening sensitive constants.
It targets software protection experiments and demonstrates defensive techniques that can be adapted to game security tooling.
