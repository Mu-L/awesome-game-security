# Game Engine Development Resources

## Overview

This skill covers game engine development resources from the awesome-game-security collection, including both commercial (Unreal, Unity) and open-source engines.

## Major Engine Categories

### Unreal Engine
- Official documentation and forums
- Source code access (requires Epic Games account)
- Community guides and tutorials
- Plugin development references

### Unity Engine
- C# reference source code
- Asset store resources
- Unity-specific design patterns
- VR/AR development guides

### Open Source Engines
- **Godot**: Free and open-source, supports GDScript and C#
- **Cocos2d-x**: Cross-platform 2D game framework
- **CRYENGINE**: High-fidelity graphics engine
- **Source Engine**: Valve's game engine (various versions)

### Custom/Educational Engines
- Hazel Engine (TheCherno's educational series)
- Bevy (Rust-based data-driven engine)
- Fyrox (Rust game engine)

## Key Technical Areas

### Rendering
- Software renderers for learning
- Ray tracing implementations
- Shader development tutorials
- Post-processing effects

### Mathematics
- Linear algebra libraries (GLM, DirectXMath)
- Physics simulation (PhysX, Bullet)
- Collision detection algorithms

### Networking
- Client-server architectures
- KCP reliable UDP protocol
- Steam networking integration
- MMORPG server implementations

## Resource Categories

### Documentation & Guides
```markdown
- Learning resources and tutorials
- Architecture documentation
- Best practices and style guides
```

### Source Code
```markdown
- Complete engine implementations
- Subsystem references (renderer, physics, audio)
- Plugin and extension examples
```

### Plugins & Extensions
```markdown
- ImGui integration for debug UIs
- Scripting language bindings (Lua, .NET)
- Editor tool plugins
```

## Engine Selection Criteria

When researching engines for security analysis or development:

1. **Target Platform**: PC, mobile, console compatibility
2. **Source Access**: Open source vs proprietary
3. **Language**: C++, C#, Rust, or scripting
4. **Graphics API**: DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal
5. **Community**: Documentation and support quality

## Security Research Focus

For game security research, understanding engine internals helps with:
- Memory layout and object structures
- Rendering pipeline hooks
- Network protocol analysis
- Anti-cheat integration points

## Data Source

**Important**: This skill provides conceptual guidance and overview information. For detailed information use the following sources:

### 1. Project Overview & Resource Index

Fetch the main README for the full curated list of repositories, tools, and descriptions:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmh5225/awesome-game-security/refs/heads/main/README.md
```

The main README contains thousands of curated links organized by category. When users ask for specific tools, projects, or implementations, retrieve and reference the appropriate sections from this source.

### 2. Repository Code Details (Archive)

For detailed repository information (file structure, source code, implementation details), the project maintains a local archive. If a repository has been archived, **always prefer fetching from the archive** over cloning or browsing GitHub directly.

**Archive URL format:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmh5225/awesome-game-security/refs/heads/main/archive/{owner}/{repo}.txt
```

**Examples:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmh5225/awesome-game-security/refs/heads/main/archive/ufrisk/pcileech.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmh5225/awesome-game-security/refs/heads/main/archive/000-aki-000/GameDebugMenu.txt
```

**How to use:**
1. Identify the GitHub repository the user is asking about (owner and repo name from the URL).
2. Construct the archive URL: replace `{owner}` with the GitHub username/org and `{repo}` with the repository name (no `.git` suffix).
3. Fetch the archive file — it contains a full code snapshot with file trees and source code generated by `code2prompt`.
4. If the fetch returns a 404, the repository has not been archived yet; fall back to the README or direct GitHub browsing.
